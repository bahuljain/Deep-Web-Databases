Nurse Trapped in Crashed Car Sets Her Own Broken Legs

   August 25, 2015 | By Jacqueline Andriakos

   A 27-year-old Canadian nurse came to her own brave and painful rescue
   after a terrible [98]car crash left her trapped in her vehicle for
   14 hours.

   Stacie Reis, of British Columbia, Canada, was nearing the end of a long
   drive home after visiting her sick grandpa when her car crashed 40 feet
   down a steep cliff not visible from the highway. She awoke in her
   vehicle with no memory of how the[99] accident occurred, but realized
   her totaled car was upside down and her legs and feet were both twisted
   towards her left knee.

   A neo-natal intensive care unit nurse at the University Hospital of
   Northern BC, Reis’ [100]medical instincts quickly kicked into gear and
   she knew she had to do something.

   “I noticed my feet were real broken,” she recently told Canada’s Global
   News [101]while recovering in her hospital bed in Vancouver. “They were
   twisted to the side. My little nurse brain was like, you’ve got to
   straighten those up because you’re going to … lose your blood supply,
   and then you’re going to lose your legs.”

   And that’s exactly what she did. Reis [102]proceeded to lift her broken
   legs and physically straighten out the bones herself, telling local
   paper the Prince George Citizen it was “quite painful to do.”

   She continued waiting for rescue through the night, in and out of
   sleep, until just after 8 a.m. the following day when she heard the
   familiar voices of her friends and family shouting her name. They had
   been driving up and down the highway looking for her. Rescuers trekked
   to Reis, broke the car windshield and pulled her safely up to the road
   on a stretcher.

   Doctors later told Reis that her decision to set her own legs likely
   saved her from having them amputated. But her lower limbs were not the
   extent of her injuries, which also included a broken sternum, ribs, and
   pelvis, in addition to bruising to her heart and lungs, Global News
   reported.

   It’s been six weeks since the crash, and Reis has now had five
   surgeries—according to a [104]GoFundMe fundraising page set up by
   coworker Colleen Rea—including a muscle and skin graft to her right
   foot. Her friend set up the page to help collect money to go towards
   her “beautiful” and “bubbly” friend’s many medical costs. The page has
   raised more than $17,000.

   It will likely be a year before Reis will use her legs again, according
   to the news outlets, but she has kept a positive outlook every step of
   the way.

   “Smelling fresh air, even eating food after the accident—it’s like I’m
   a baby, it’s like eating it for the first time,” Reis told the Prince
   George Citizen. “You sure gain perspective when you’ve been in a life
   threatening accident.”
