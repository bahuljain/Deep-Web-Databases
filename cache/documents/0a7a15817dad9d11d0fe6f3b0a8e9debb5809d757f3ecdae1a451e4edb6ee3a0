Welcome to the Java Developer Center

   [info_metro12_1.gif] Yahoo! Language centers have been deprecated. If
   you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us
   in [16]General Discussion at YDN forum.

   Java is a tried and true programming language that powers many
   enterprise-class web applications. In the Java Developer Center, you'll
   find:
     * [17]HOWTO Articles to help you understand our technologies and how
       you can use them better with Java.
          + [18]Prerequisites
          + [19]Articles
     * [20]Code Samples Used by our HOWTOs for you to play with. Use them
       as a starting point for your own applications.
     * [21]Java Downloads and Libraries to get you started writing great
       Java code.
     * [22]More Information About Java Programming out on the Web to help
       you use Java and the Yahoo! APIs to their fullest.
     * [23]Community Resources where you can join our mailing list and
       discuss the Yahoo! APIs with other Java developers.

HOWTO Articles

Prerequisites

   Most of the Java sample code provided in the HOWTO articles require
   only [24]Java version 1.4.2 or newer which includes the standard
   javax.xml.* packages and the [25]HTTPClient packages from Apache. The
   exceptions are the Mail API, which requires either the [26]JAX-WS or
   [27]Axis2 libraries, and the JSON example which requires the
   [28]org.json package. [29]Whirlycache is required for the in-memory
   caching example.
