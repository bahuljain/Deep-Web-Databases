Aerobic, anaerobic and cardio-vascular?

   I know that aerobic means with air and anaerobic means without air, but
   what exercises are considered anaerobic, are they just the exercises
   that make you run out of breath? If jogging is aerobic (for most
   people), but you get tired from jogging is that anaerobic or aerobic?
   Also do anaerobic exercises work... [114]show more I know that aerobic

       ok anaerobic is a long continuous workout (usually at least 20
       min.) this allows you to constantly build up muscle endurance and
       thus cardio endurance as well as you push your pace...anaerobic is
       short burst of activity ie sprinting... this also works your cardio
       but is not always as effective as aerobic especially since it
       causes a build up of lactic acid...the best way to get the best
       from working out is to a long run after a hard anaerobic workout to
       clear your muscles of lactic acid therein getting benefits from
       both aerobic and anaerobic
