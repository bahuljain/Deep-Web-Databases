   This is a story about my sons first year in football. I'll try to be
   brief but descriptive:
   My son, Adam, is 8 and loves football. Adam was 3 when he was diagnosed
   with type 1 diabetes. After resisting for a year, we finally gave in to
   his desire to play football. He loves it but admitedly has had some
   bumps and bruises. As his father, i was allowed to be on the sidelines
   to care for him during the games. I was very grateful. On the sidelines
   you see and hear things you wouldn't if not there. I clearly overheard
   a coach repeatedly cussing as he came off the field. This went far
   beyond the classics such as hell, damn, etc., Also from this same coach
   came frustrations such as "I give up" in front of the kids. Kids who
   obviously came off the field hurt with some sort of injury were quickly
   triaged by this coach and immediately sent back in to play risking
   further injury.
   Injuries are part of all sports and physical activities. Mild language,
   I feel, could have been overlooked maybe. The defeatest attitude of "I
   give up" is not healthy for the kids to overhear. So I took it upon
   myself to address this with the Head Coach. The irresponsible coach was
   removed FOR A GAME but was still allowed to attend. During that game I
   noticed some of the same kids who get very little play time sitting
   along the sidelines but now my son, Adam, was joining them. By me
   escalating this matter, my son was apparently being punished with lack
   of play time or so it appeared.
   There are volunteer spotters (parents who track the amount of plays
   each player is in the game). I had the priviledge of spotting the first
   game. Essentially it's confusing enough with constant substitutions to
   cause the spotter(s) to miss the game. At this age, each player should
   get a minimum of 13 plays each game. At halftime, after watching my son
   (and others) sit for all but a handful of plays, I decided to ask the
   spotters who still needs plays. "Everyone has all their plays", I was
   told. I was floored. My reaction I'm sure was disbelief but then I
   realized by the limited vocabulary of this spotter from the opposing
   team that I obviously upset him and was then hit with a steady barrage
   of being called a "dude". I chose to walk away.
   For that minor incident I was reprimanded and barred from attending my
   sons next game. I was banished from the sidelines so now I can not give
   my son immediate care. If not for my wife, I would have sent this coach
   and league, our resignation letter a while ago. The head coach has
   stated through emails that he can not do this without the help of "the
   cussing coach". Both my wife and I were shocked that this head coach
   was essentially condoning this sort of behavior around small children.
   Although he hasn't returned yet to coach, I worry for the kids when he
   does.
   I would be the first to admit, this isn't going to happen 100% of the
   time. All leagues and coaches are different. Each leagues goals and
   motivations are not win at all costs as ours seems to be. Anyone have
   advice and/or similar experiences??

   I don't really have any advice but as a teacher I congratulate you on
   looking out for the interests of young children and speaking up about
   questionable behavior. However, I'm not really a fan of organized
   sports for children that young and want to point out that one option is
   to walk away.
   What about videoing the games in case there is a question of your word
   against theirs?

   I agree that the cussing is not great but is not *nearly* as big a deal
   as saying "I give up" in front of a bunch of 8 year olds. I helped
   teach martial arts to kids for a couple of years not too long ago and
   that is the *worst* sort of thing you can say to kids that age as they
   will remember that more than just about anything else you tell them.
   Participation and effort and teamwork are all much more important
   lessons to learn at that age than 'winning' or 'playing time'. I ran
   into tons of parents who end up REALLY disappointed when their kids
   they've pushed hard through youth sports don't quite make the cut in
   college or lose interest in high school. I've heard people talking
   seriously about junior high kids 'working' towards college
   scholarships? Sorry, I know it's fun to read Sports Illustrated but
   give me a break. Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure what to suggest
   you do about the situation since it seems like there's definitely an
   entrenched and seemingly cliquish group in that football league. Good
   luck though. Maybe switch to track or cross country? Some of the same
   stuff goes on but I think that it's diffused by the sort of style of
   the sport?

   It's really amazing how wrapped up some of these coaches get during a
   football game where most of the kids are 8 or 9. I only have girls, but
   they were cheerleaders in their very young days and I heard a lot of
   unnecessary bad language from some of the coaches and observed too many
   "power plays" among coaches and parents, such as making kids sit out
   for various unfounded reasons. And I have seen 8-year-olds vomit before
   a game, while the coaches are literally yelling at the kids right in
   front of them.
   What they did to you was really wrong. I can't imagine that they have
   the right to bar you from the next game, especially since at age 8,
   your child needs you there for safety reasons. What would they do if
   your son had a problem? They are wrongly punishing your son for a
   question that you asked. Unfortunately, it's probably better to just
   continue on, and if it seems like your son is still spending too much
   time on the bench, I would contact someone higher up in the league to
   let them know what's going on.
   Good luck with this. I know that it is really hard to watch your child
   be treated unfairly, especially at such a young age.

   The real point of my post was tell you about the total disregard for a
   childs safety who in our case may need immediate medical attention. I
   thank all who posted responses.
   After talking to many of the parents, I learned that some had emailed
   the head coach with similar concerns about this coachs negative
   attidude even before I did. The children from those same parents are
   the ones usually not seeing action in the games. And even after these
   emails complaining, this head coach had the nerve to tell the parents
   that he needs this guy back.
   In all sports for children we should not lose focus of the real goal
   and that's to learn, develop new skills and to have fun. Safety should
   always be a major concern.

   Hi Pam,
   Thank you for your thoughts and ideas. I do like the video idea. Now if
   I could just find that recharger... BigGrin
   Oh I would've walked away right after this happened but felt I would've
   been denying Adam time to play a sport he is crazy about even if it was
   not that much. Also my wife didn't like the idea of Adam quitting at
   anything. I was overruled!!

   i hate to play devil's advocate here. now let me add i played highly
   competitve youth- college sports, and represented the U.S. youth soccer
   team, and played football as well.
   now while some people may come off as harsher than nice have you
   considered the fact that as you said the only ones compaining are the
   ones 'not getting enough playing time'
   now while i have my concerns on the i give up quote, words are words
   and in my personal opinion a lot of the problems we have is the over
   sensitivity to every thing and words in particular in how they pertain
   to our offspring.
   i know when i was a youth trying to make a name for oneself, i would
   push myself past the puking point to push the envelope because next
   time it would be easier. i had oaches that were nice, not nice, smart,
   hickish, black white constervative and liberal good and bad, hell some
   even drank liquor on the side lines. all had something informative to
   teach i just had to figure what it was and some times just the
   adversity faced in dealing with ignorant people has taught me more life
   lessons than any sport. but again i am not to popular around here right
   now because i speak my mind but we all come from different places and
   if you don't like how your kid is being taught take him to the next
   town over or maybe try a new sport.

   Ehtics and all of the B$ that goes along with youth sports aside, have
   you considered getting him a continous glocuse monitor? I believe that
   the Freestyle Navigator has a range of up to 10 feet. I don't use one,
   so, this might not be a good suggestion, but you would'nt have to be
   right on the sideline, if the field is set up in a way that you could
   be witin 10 feet of him while he's not in the game. Also, the Navigator
   says that it checks every 1-2 minutes, so it would be pretty quick.

   Jason, the Navigator has not been in production for many months in the
   U.S. and people have been given money back from Abbott to purchase
   another CGM. There is some FDA involvement and no idea if or when it
   will be available in this country again. The range for Navigator is
   actually much more than 10 feet, my son still uses one.

   Melissa is also an adult, with an intellectual disability, therefore
   she needs lots of help managing her diabetes. She uses an Omnipod pump

   Yeh, I don't use one. When I said 10 feet for the Navigator, I was just
   going by what I saw online, I didn't realize they were out of
   production. What kind of range does your dexcom get?
