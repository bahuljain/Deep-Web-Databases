Playing Tackle Football Before Age 12 Linked to Higher Risk of Cognitive
Problems Later in Life

   HealthDay Reporter

   WEDNESDAY, Jan. 28, 2015 (HealthDay News) — As football fans prepare to
   watch the 49th Super Bowl this Sunday, a new study suggests that boys
   who start playing tackle football before the age of 12 may face a
   higher risk for neurological deficits as adults.

   The concern stems from an assessment of current memory and thinking
   skills among 42 former National Football League players, now between
   the ages of 40 and 69. Half the players had started playing tackle
   football at age 11 or younger.

   The bottom line: Regardless of their current age or total years playing
   football, NFL players who were that young when they first played the
   game scored notably worse on all measures than those who started
   playing at age 12 or later.

   “It is very important that we err on the side of caution and not
   over-interpret these findings,” said study co-author Robert Stern, a
   professor of neurology, neurosurgery, anatomy and neurobiology at
   Boston University’s School of Medicine. “This is just one research
   study that had as its focus former NFL players. So we can’t generalize
   from this to anyone else.

   “At the same time,” Stern added, “this study provides a little bit of
   evidence that starting to hit your head before the age of 12 over and
   over again may have long-term ramifications. So the question is, if we
   know that there’s a time in childhood where the young, vulnerable brain
   is developing so actively, do we take care of it, or do we expose our
   kids to hit after hit after hit?”

   Stern, who is also the director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center
   Clinical Core and director of clinical research at the Chronic
   Traumatic Encephalopathy Center at the university, reported the
   findings with his colleagues in the Jan. 28 issue of Neurology.

   The study authors pointed out that, on average, children who play
   football between the ages of 9 and 12 experience between 240 and 585
   head hits per season, with a force that is comparable to that
   experienced by high school and college players.

   In 2011, investigators recruited former NFL players to participate in
   an ongoing study called DETECT. The players’ average age was 52, and
   all had played at least two years in the NFL and 12 years of “organized
   football.” All had sustained a comparable number of concussions
   throughout their careers.

   All had a minimum six-month history of mental health complaints,
   including problems with thinking clearly, behavior and mood.

   All underwent a standardized battery of neurological testing to assess
   learning, reading and verbal capacities, as well as memory and planning
   skills.

   The result: all the players performed below average on several of the
   assessments. But by many measures, the overall mental functioning of
   those who started playing before age 12 registered roughly 20 percent
   below that of those who started at age 12 and older.

   For example, the early start group performed worse in terms of
   immediate and delayed verbal-recall tests, and were deemed less
   mentally “flexible” than the 12-and-up group.

   While the researchers found a link between age at which players started
   to play football and later mental functioning, it didn’t prove cause
   and effect.

   “Now I want to be clear that we’re not talking about the impact of
   concussions here,” Stern said. “I know that the emphasis of late has
   been on concussions. But what I’m more concerned about are all of those
   repetitive hits that we refer to as sub-concussive trauma. The player
   may have no complaints at all, no obvious problems. But their brain is
   jostled over and over again inside the skull, right at the time when
   it’s trying to do its best to grow and develop.

   “So, this should not be taken as a definitive study that leads to
   policy or rule changes,” he added. “Participation in youth sports is
   tremendously beneficial. But parents should be aware of this. And if
   there is an option to play, say, flag football at that age — where one
   can learn all of the important social skills of team participation and
   have as much fun, but take the brain out of it — then I say we should
   do that.”

   That thought is seconded by Dr. Christopher Filley, author of an
   editorial accompanying Stern’s study, and a professor of neurology at
   the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.

   “These players who were studied all wore helmets throughout their
   entire playing careers,” he said. “But we don’t think helmets have much
   of an effect on preventing brain injury. The game is inherently
   violent. That may not be the case if we’re talking about touch
   football. But if it’s to be played with the rules that are now favored,
   there will always be an inherent risk, regardless.

   “Now, obviously there are benefits to physical activity and team
   sports,” Filley added. “But the potential is that the younger brain is
   more vulnerable to injury than the older brain, which is why I think
   this is an important study, and a cautionary tale. It’s not the final
   word on the issue. We need more data. But this a tough conversation
   that is definitely worth having.”
