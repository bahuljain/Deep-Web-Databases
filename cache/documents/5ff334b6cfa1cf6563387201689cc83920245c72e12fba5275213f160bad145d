Blood Pressure Meds Lower Heart, Stroke Risks in Diabetics: Analysis

   February 10, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [cardio_MIC072ML.jpg]

   By Randy Dotinga
   HealthDay Reporter

   TUESDAY, Feb. 10, 2015 (HealthDay News) — A new analysis shows that
   people with type 2 diabetes are less likely to suffer heart attacks,
   strokes or die early when they take blood pressure medications — even
   if they don’t actually have high blood pressure.

   “Stroke, heart attack and other circulatory diseases are the biggest
   cause of premature death and disability in people with diabetes,” said
   review author Dr. Kazem Rahimi, deputy director with the George
   Institute for Global Health at the University of Oxford in England.
   “Any intervention that safely reduces the risk, even if modestly, will
   have an important effect.”

   According to the American Diabetes Association, an estimated two-thirds
   of people with diabetes have high blood pressure or take blood pressure
   medication. Diabetics tend to have higher blood pressure than other
   people, Rahimi said, and this can lead to health problems.

   It’s clear that lowering high blood pressure is good for diabetics,
   Rahimi said, but it’s less certain whether patients “whose blood
   pressure is not very high should be treated with blood
   pressure-lowering drugs and how far their blood pressure should be
   reduced. It is also less well-known how blood pressure-lowering affects
   a range of other potential health complications such as diabetic eye
   disease.”

   Blood pressure-lowering drugs are not harmless. While they’re often
   inexpensive, sometimes costing just pennies per pill, they can cause
   side effects such as dizziness and fatigue.

   In the new review, researchers analyzed 40 studies with a total of just
   over 100,000 participants. The studies were randomized and controlled,
   meaning some diabetics got the blood-pressure medications and some
   didn’t; researchers then watched to see what happened next.

   Each decrease of 10 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure reading — the
   top number in a reading — lowered the risk of early death by 13
   percent, heart attacks and similar problems by 11 percent, coronary
   heart disease by 12 percent and stroke by 27 percent. The study found
   that the risk of albuminuria (too much protein in the urine) and
   retinopathy (an eye condition) also fell, by 17 percent and 13 percent,
   respectively.

   What did diabetes have to do with the lowering of risk in the patients
   who took blood pressure medications? It’s not clear. Rahimi said it’s
   possible that the results could be similar in people without diabetes.
   Research continues into this question, he noted.

   Dr. Bryan Williams, a professor of medicine with University College
   London who studies high blood pressure and diabetes, said the review
   findings suggest “we should consider lowering blood pressure further
   than recommended in current guidelines” to reduce the risk of stroke.

   Williams, who wrote a commentary accompanying the review, added: “If I
   was a younger diabetic, I would certainly want my blood pressure well
   controlled, always below 140/90 mm Hg and below 130/80 mm Hg if
   possible. As patients get older, they sometimes tolerate such
   aggressive treatment less well, but it is worth trying to reach a level
   of blood pressure that is as low as tolerated without symptoms.”

   What’s next? Rahimi said he expects the study will change how doctors
   treat patients with diabetes, especially because the review didn’t show
   signs of harm from the blood pressure medications.

   Still, the research showed that the positive effect of the drugs was
   smaller in diabetics with lower blood pressure levels. “For a small
   group of diabetic people,” he said, “this could mean that the expected
   benefit of blood pressure-lowering may not be large enough for them to
   take blood pressure-lowering tablets.”

   The study was published in the Feb. 10 issue of the Journal of the
   American Medical Association.
