   When you ask a doctor a question, you expect an answer backed by the
   [93]latest science. But the reality is, the field of medicine is
   [94]always advancing, and “there's too much knowledge for any one
   physician to master,” says Renée Fox, PhD, professor emerita at the
   University of Pennsylvania, who studies the sociology of medical
   research, education and ethics. As a result, certain popular beliefs
   that seem to make sense persist long after they've been challenged by
   studies. So we asked a range of experts, “What [95]health myths drive
   you nuts?” Here, they bust five vexing misconceptions.

   MYTH: “Rest is best for back pain.”
   THE ORIGINS
   In years past, doctors tended to assume the worstthat [97]back pain
   was a sign of a serious injuryand thought the [98]way to heal was to
   stay off your feet. Today we know that most soreness stems from the
   muscles, ligaments and joints. Yet “many ER and primary care doctors
   still default to 'rest' out of uncertainty or a fear of liability,”
   says Robert Eastlack, MD, codirector of the San Diego Spine Fellowship
   at the Scripps Clinic for Orthopedic Surgery.
   SCIENCE SAYS
   The vast majority of back problems from lumbar sprains to slipped
   disks[99]benefit from activity, according to 2007 guidelines from the
   American College of Physicians. Studies have shown that bed rest
   actually makes pain worse and last longer. “The key is to keep moving,”
   says Dr. Eastlackto stretch out tight muscle fibers and prevent your
   joints from stiffening. He suggests starting with gentle daily
   exercise, like walking or swimming. Then gradually work your way up to
   more [100]vigorous activities, like running, yoga or spin, as you
   become able to tolerate them. If the pain worsens or hasn't improved
   significantly in four to six weeks, get it checked out by your doctor.

   MYTH: “Hormone replacement therapy causes cancer.”
   THE ORIGINS
   Docs can be skittish about prescribing estrogen to ease symptoms of
   [102]menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But they're
   probably clinging to outdated findings from a 2002 NIH Womens Health
   Initiative study that linked hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to a
   slightly elevated risk of [103]breast cancer—even though more recent
   research has demonstrated that that risk is not associated with how HRT
   is formulated and prescribed today.
   SCIENCE SAYS
   Several large studies have shown that taking estrogen is safe, says
   Mary Jane Minkin, MD, clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology and
   reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine: “It really makes me
   crazy when doctors tell patients they'll suffer terrible consequences
   from hormone therapy.” Typically it's needed for only two to three
   years to treat menopausal symptoms, she adds. There are women who cant
   take estrogen (say, because of a history of breast cancer or blood
   clots). For them there's another option to ease hot flashes: Brisdelle,
   a very low-dose [104]antidepressant.
