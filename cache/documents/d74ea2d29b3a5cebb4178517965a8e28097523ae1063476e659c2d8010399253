Addicted to Coffee? Why Genetics May Be Partly to Blame

   HealthDay Reporter

   TUESDAY, Oct. 7, 2014 (HealthDay News) — Folks who chug lots of coffee
   may have their genetics to thank for their java cravings, a new study
   says.

   Researchers have linked six genes to a person’s coffee consumption. All
   of the genes are related to the body’s response to caffeine, according
   to the study.

   “These are genes that we previously would not have implicated with
   coffee, and they show that there is some genetic basis for our coffee
   consumption behavior,” said lead author Marilyn Cornelis, a research
   associate in nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.

   These genes could help explain why some people enjoy coffee more than
   others. “My response to a cup of coffee might be very different to
   someone else’s response to the same cup,” Cornelis said.

   They also could explain the popularity of energy drinks and other
   products that contain caffeine, said Rachel Poole, a postdoctoral
   fellow at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a
   nonprofit scientific institute dedicated to research on the senses of
   taste and smell.

   “In the past coffee and tea were the primary sources of caffeine
   worldwide. Now, there are many more products that contain caffeine —
   energy drinks, flavored waters, gums,” Poole said. “Therefore, it is
   important that we understand genetic factors underlying caffeine intake
   as caffeine consumption patterns have changed.”

   Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, according to
   background information in the study. In North America, people who drink
   coffee generally consume about two cups a day. In Europe, the average
   is about four cups daily, the study reports.

   Previous research has linked regular coffee consumption to a reduced
   risk of Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease,
   according to the study. However, not all research on coffee is
   positive. The beverage has also been implicated in cardiovascular
   problems and other health issues, the study reported.

   Researchers discovered the six “coffee” genes after reviewing 28
   previous studies on the genetic makeup of more than 120,000 coffee
   drinkers. They compared each person’s genetics to how much coffee they
   said they regularly drink each day.

   “Out of 2.5 million variants in the genome, we found a handful that
   were strongly linked to coffee consumption,” Cornelis said.

   Two of the genes are related to the way a person’s body metabolizes
   caffeine, the study reports.

   “Individuals that consume larger quantities of coffee may metabolize
   caffeine more quickly than others, and this could be due to their
   genetic makeup,” Poole said.

   Another two genes appear linked to the “kick” that a person receives
   from caffeine. These genes are tied to the brain’s pleasure centers,
   and likely influence the amount of stimulation or enjoyment that
   caffeine provides, Cornelis said.

   The final two genes “were really unexpected,” Cornelis said. Those
   genes previously have been linked to metabolism of fats and sugars, but
   had not been suspected as influencing the body’s response to coffee.

   This indicates that the genes may impact the brain process that senses
   blood glucose levels, which may in turn influence a person’s response
   to caffeine.

   Poole warned that while these specific genes respond to caffeine, there
   likely are other factors that influence a person’s love of coffee.

   “It would not be correct to conclude that coffee consumption is driven
   solely by genetic responses to caffeine. There are many bioactive
   compounds in coffee that could determine coffee consumption,” she said.
   “Furthermore, many people add milk and sugar to their coffee, and
   genetic factors underlying milk and sugar intake could play a role in
   coffee intake.”

   The next step in the research will be to examine the genes identified
   in this study and see if they impact the risk of certain diseases,
   Cornelis said.

   The findings were published Oct. 7 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.
