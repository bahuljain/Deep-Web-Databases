Question Buffer underrun (audio)

     hi people, iam a computer music producer . i use fruityloops for
     production. now iam facing buffer under run problem. all my projects
     are clicking n distorted. i am confused. is it happening bcos of the
     cpu buffers got damaged or the sound card. do sound cards have
     buffers??
     waiting for ur help
     tnx

     A buffer underrun is an empty buffer, for some reason your system
     can't keep a buffer filled fast enough. The reason for this could be
     caused by an hard drive which is not fast enough, bottleneck in ram
     bandwidth or not enough cpu processing power available.
     Not knowing more about your computer, your o/s and what exactly what
     you were doing with your computer end-up with vague explanations.

     i will explain about my system later. in betwn, can it happen bcos
     of buffer damage of processor. or anything with soundcard should i
     change the cpu??

     Don't think about changing nothing yet. We need more information
     before trying to assess the problem. Give the information and we'll
     try to help you solve the problem.

     Hi Kalki,
     Can you please explain what you mean by buffer damage? There are
     buffers in the CPU, but if they become damaged it is most likely
     that your CPU will either just stop working (lock up) or the data
     will become corrupt (and more corrupt over time, essentially leading
     to a lock up). The Sound Card has a buffer on it that takes data
     from the rest of the sytem, either the hard disk if it is
     pre-created or probably the CPU if you are creating the sound when
     it is being created. If it is coming from the CPU it will be
     transferred through the chipset (actually, most likely to the RAM
     then the chipset), and into the sound card hardware where it is
     translated (or looked up from ROM tables, if you are playing MIDI),
     put into a buffer, then converted to analog signals for shipping out
     to your speakers.
     So, in order to help you diagnose, we really need more information.
     Did this problem recently start, or did you buy a new system? What
     type of hardware does the system have?
     So, if you have a newer system but you are using sound card hardware
     that is built onto the motherboard, then I would guess that the
     hardware simply was not designed to be used by professionals
     developing music from mulitple channels (they are more designed for
     playing games and simpler things like that). In that case I would
     suggest buying a new sound card that is not built into the MB.
     If you are using an older system that has gotten worse over time,
     then we can look in other directions. First, all transactions
     handled by the sound card have to be handled by the driver (all
     transfers of data, etc.). That driver runs on the CPU, and if you
     have installed more programs over time (virus scans, etc) that run
     in the background, it could be that the sound card software is not
     getting the priority it used to (other things are using the CPU). In
     that case, you might need to disable some of the other software
     programs running in the background when you start developing music.
     Or upgrade to a newer, dual core processor that is more designed to
     handle all the other stuff and still give you plenty of speed in
     your primary task. Another possiblity is that you have other
     hardware conflicting with the sound card (assigned to the same
     interrupt channel) that keeps the sound card from getting the
     attention it needs. You can check the resources by going into the
     system information icon in the Control Panel and finding your sound
     card to see if it has any conflicts of resources. One final
     possiblity is that you are using hardware that is using bus
     bandwidth that the sound card needs to fill its buffers. For
     example, if you are using a network card on the same bus as the
     sound card, the network card can typically nearly saturate the
     bandwidth of the bus it is operating on, essentially starving all
     other hardware on the same bus (and would cause buffer underruns).
     So, in summary, it is obvious that your sound card cannot keep it's
     buffers full, but there are a huge number of possibilities as to why
     that could be. One of them is not, however, damaged buffers in your
     CPU. But, without more information from your end, you are expecting
     the helpful people here to throw solutions at a (nearly) boundless
     problems without really having an understanding for the problem. No
     debugger worth his salt would even attempt that, and you are asking
     them to know more about your situation than you are willing to
     disclose. If you are looking to separate sound card from CPU, if one
     of the two is damaged, it is almost certainly the sound card. But,
     without more info, I could not reccomend replacing that either
     (unless you are losing money from this problem faster than it would
     cost you to just get a newer system, then you have an obvious
     cost-benefit with just buying new hardware).
     So, if you could please let us know more about your problem, then we
     could help you to solve it (and at no cost to you... )

     he-he, well, our son woke up at 5:30 this morning, and I was just
     waiting for him to finish his breakfast and waiting for my Dad to
     show up to take him out for the day (my wife is currently unable to
     help care for him), so I needed something to do...

     In FruityLoops audio settings you could try upping the sound buffer
     latency (in milliseconds) a bit.

     My pc config is
     AMD athlon XP 2000+ 1.6ghz
     256MB Ram
     AC'97 soundcard with vinyl AC'97 audio driver
     OS - XP
     i use this system for only makin music. i did the same before the
     day i got this problem. nothing else. i sat whole night n made
     something n in the morning when i opened it the track was clipping
     alot. i tried everything. but nothing happened. i even reinstalled
     the XP.
     the thing i suspect is that i used ASIO4ALL drive some time for the
     sound card. in fruity loops manual its said that "use it at ur own
     risk". if that the cause which part of my pc is damaged.
     i have used virtual synthsisers(VST) for creating sounds. samples
     where less. vsts runs on real time processing. so its uses cpu alot
     not hardisk. where wave samples are loaded in ram from disk n use
     the mem.

     Kalki,
     Thanks for the additional information. First, let me stress that I
     am not a music producer, nor have I ever done that sort of thing or
     used the programs that you refer to. But, from my experience, I
     would strongly reccomend that you NEVER use an AC'97 audio device
     for anything other than the very basic playing of sounds for gaming
     through two crappy speakers, and even then it is not reccomended...
     The newer built-in sound cards are better, but from the timeframe
     that you got yours they were quite frankly only intended for those
     that wanted to have a system with a very tight budget. Developing
     music on one of those devices would be, in my opinion, like trying
     to move all your belongings accross the country in a Yugo, sure you
     might be able to but at much peril to yourself... Not that I would
     say that you should have known that, but from a hardware standpoint
     those devices are not made to do alot of work.
     OK, so with that said, that does not mean that the AC'97 audio is
     definitely the problem, but I would say it is probably a 90% chance,
     in my experience. The chance that a hardware problem in another part
     of the system would show itself only in bad audio is highly
     unlikely. You are more likely to see blue-screens, lockups, or other
     problems if you have bad RAM, a problem in your CPU or other
     hardware (hard-disk, etc).
     Unfortunately, if a problem is really with the hardware, without
     having very expensive test equipment, and an advanced knowledge of
     the specifications of the hardware that would only come from having
     designed it, the only real way to debug it is to replace it. If I
     were you (and I don't know your financial situation, etc.), I would
     certainly start with buying a new, non-built in sound card. Even if
     that is not the problem with your system, you would still be doing
     yourself a great service if you are really serious about using your
     system for developing music. That hardware would be much more
     capable and designed for the tasks that you are using it for. Not
     sure where you are writing from, but in the United States you can
     pick up a Sound Blaster Audigy for around $30, which is really
     fairly low even though this is a several generations old card and is
     mostly geared at the game player's market, it will be far more
     capable than the AC'97 audio. If you are really serious about
     developing audio, then there are cards with more advanced features
     for doing that type of work for the $100-$200 price range.
     As to the rest of the system, although it is only and AMD system
     (Sorry, had to say that... ), it is more than capable for what you
     are using it for. I would say that if you start woking with music
     files much more than probably around 100MB, you would probably be
     better off with more than 256MB or RAM in your system (after you
     fill up the RAM, you have to start getting data from the much slower
     hard disk, and Windows XP usually uses a good portion of 256MB
     without running much else), so I would say that 512MB would probably
     be better in your situation. Upgrading that would not hurt anything
     other than your pocketbook.
     Hope this helps,

     Kalki,
     Thanks for the additional information. First, let me stress that I
     am not a music producer, nor have I ever done that sort of thing or
     used the programs that you refer to. But, from my experience, I
     would strongly reccomend that you NEVER use an AC'97 audio device
     for anything other than the very basic playing of sounds for gaming
     through two crappy speakers, and even then it is not reccomended...
     The newer built-in sound cards are better, but from the timeframe
     that you got yours they were quite frankly only intended for those
     that wanted to have a system with a very tight budget. Developing
     music on one of those devices would be, in my opinion, like trying
     to move all your belongings accross the country in a Yugo, sure you
     might be able to but at much peril to yourself... Not that I would
     say that you should have known that, but from a hardware standpoint
     those devices are not made to do alot of work.
     OK, so with that said, that does not mean that the AC'97 audio is
     definitely the problem, but I would say it is probably a 90% chance,
     in my experience. The chance that a hardware problem in another part
     of the system would show itself only in bad audio is highly
     unlikely. You are more likely to see blue-screens, lockups, or other
     problems if you have bad RAM, a problem in your CPU or other
     hardware (hard-disk, etc).
     Unfortunately, if a problem is really with the hardware, without
     having very expensive test equipment, and an advanced knowledge of
     the specifications of the hardware that would only come from having
     designed it, the only real way to debug it is to replace it. If I
     were you (and I don't know your financial situation, etc.), I would
     certainly start with buying a new, non-built in sound card. Even if
     that is not the problem with your system, you would still be doing
     yourself a great service if you are really serious about using your
     system for developing music. That hardware would be much more
     capable and designed for the tasks that you are using it for. Not
     sure where you are writing from, but in the United States you can
     pick up a Sound Blaster Audigy for around $30, which is really
     fairly low even though this is a several generations old card and is
     mostly geared at the game player's market, it will be far more
     capable than the AC'97 audio. If you are really serious about
     developing audio, then there are cards with more advanced features
     for doing that type of work for the $100-$200 price range.
     As to the rest of the system, although it is only and AMD system
     (Sorry, had to say that... ), it is more than capable for what you
     are using it for. I would say that if you start woking with music
     files much more than probably around 100MB, you would probably be
     better off with more than 256MB or RAM in your system (after you
     fill up the RAM, you have to start getting data from the much slower
     hard disk, and Windows XP usually uses a good portion of 256MB
     without running much else), so I would say that 512MB would probably
     be better in your situation. Upgrading that would not hurt anything
     other than your pocketbook.
     Hope this helps,
     Intel_Peep
     wooooow great help bro. what u r saying about soundcard is a fact
     that verymuch spoken in music making scene. i will upgrade my pc
     after getting some money
     As to the rest of the system, although it is only and AMD system
     (Sorry, had to say that... )
     bro, i have one p4 i don use it cos of lots of hanging problem i
     faced with that (Sorry, had to say that... )
     as u said 512MB is minimum for music production
     Thanx alot for the great help

     If you really have one, you should probably try to fix it, even the
     original P4 willy was better at streaming tasks than the amd xp
     processors.

     OK, even though you insulted my company... :P since it is the
     Christmas season, if you live in the US, I have a SB Live 5.1
     speaker PCI sound card sitting around that I will send you for the
     cost of shipping if you are interested. But only if you promise to
     upgrade to an Intel system when you get the money... Just IM me if
     you are interested, and we can work out the details. I also have a
     512MB Stick of DDR333 and an old P4 socket 478 Motherboard, we can
     see if we can work out a good deal on that too, not sure what is
     your budget, so again we could work that in IM.

     I don't know if this will help or not, but I used to have problems
     similar to this. With my Audigy 2 ZS.
     A lot of older VIA chipset motherboards have PCI latency, I turned
     that off and it worked fine..But I used to get pops very often in
     games and everything.
