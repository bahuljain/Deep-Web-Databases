   After being encouraged by some of your posts, and the current tingling
   in my toes, I am going back to the lower carb way & I'll continue to
   test, test, test as well.


   I've also learned that some of you do better with some exercise after
   every meal. I'm going to shoot for walking after lunch to start with.
   And experiment with actual breakfast instead of a snack before the
   morning gym workouts.


   Thanks especially for the calming of my reaction to possible having
   lost muscle - the nurse practioner treated it as a serious problem, so
   I did too. In retrospect & after reading your replies, I realize that a
   wait-and-see is more warranted. I suppose if I want to make sure I'm
   not breaking down muscle, I can buy some ketone test strips.


   An aside - I discovered that Chrome wasn't working with the forum
   tools, so now I'm using Internet Explorer. Sorry for the confusing
   replies I have made.

   Somehow I don't  think that nurse practitioner (quite possibly even the
   doctor) understand how that gizmo works, or just why it is wildly
   inaccurate due to so many variables. Especially considering if it was
   even remotely accurate, you would lost a rather significant amount of
   muscle mass...something you'd notice, such as feeling week Smiley Wink
   I think you can safely ignore such means of measuring fat vs. muscle
   mass.

   What I find interesting about that is that if your blood glucose was
   high (above 180mg/dl) when you were first weighed, and you lowered the
   number of carbs in your diet, chances are pretty good that your kidneys
   would stop clearing glucose out into urine, and would get rid of a lot
   less water at the same time.  You would have been dehydrated at first,
   but not by the time of the second weighing.  Sure, you would be
   retaining more water, but going from dehydration to a normal water
   level would be a good thing, and not a sign of increased fat. I wonder
   if the diet doctor took that into account.


   A total of 1200 calories doesn't necessarily sound unreasonable. I have
   often see it suggested as a good "minimum" calorie level. I am not
   convinced though, that you would need more carbs to to avoid burning
   body fat.

   Hi Rainy717,
   Noticed your post about what you typically eat for breakfast and have a
   quick comment.
   You say a typical breakfast is coffee with two pieces of buttered toast
   and that the toast is homemade whole wheat. You should test one hour
   and then two hours after this breakfast as there is a good chance that
   you will be surprised with your post meal bg spike.
   Bread, whether made from whole wheat or refined white flour, casues an
   unacceptable bg rise for many of us with t2. In fact for myself there
   is no difference between the spike I have gotten from whole wheat bread
   versus white bread.
   Check that breakfast with your meter to make certain of the effect on
   your bg.
   There are low carb breads available at most grocery stores.

   Thanks, Ruth. I have 2 eggs along with the equivalent of 1 slice of
   whole wheat bread & the coffee with cream. I thought the fiber in the
   bread would keep BG from spiking. Since it is homemade bread, I have to
   estimate the nutrition, so I weighed it and use the nutrition info for
   Nature's Own whole wheat - which only has 11g carbs/28gr, so I thought
   that would be safe. I've noticed that sometimes it makes BG go up &
   sometimes it doesn't seem to. I'm trying to eat that only when I'm
   headed to the gym that morning, especially since I'm supposed to have
   more calories than what I was doing before (only eating the eggs &
   coffee w/cream, or sometimes I'd make an omelette with a veggie or
   crustless quiche with veggies). Maybe I should eat the crustless quiche
   before hitting the gym- it tends to be higher in calories than the
   eggs/coffee/toast combo and I estimate the carbs to be about 6g. Maybe
   when the meformin finally begins to kick in, I'll be able to eat the
   toast. It just gives some variety & fiber to breakfast.

   I wondered about this, especially since I'm adding more weights (very
   little & very slowly but still increasing) at the gym workouts. It
   didn't make sense, and I didn't see the info about the scales being
   inaccurate until today. But they are supposed to be good for seeing
   your own trend even if they aren't spot-on with the measurement. And
   seeing that I had supposedly lost muscle mass was unnerving, especially
   when I've been working pretty hard.


   I do feel more confident that the scale was probably not accurate, even
   for determining a change from my previous weigh in.

   She said it only measures intramuscular water (not sure that is the
   correct idea) and that mild dehydration wouldn't make a difference. I
   work hard to stay hydrated, and I was definitely hydrated before both
   appointments.  In any event, I'm going to pay more attention to the
   amount of weights I can lift during my gym exercises and if I continue
   to be able to add weights to my routine I'll assume I am building
   muscle instead of losing it.

   Just to complicate things a bit, people without diabetes often are
   carb-loading before exercies to fuel their energy output.


   With diabetes we don't want to overdo it, but a bit more carbs before
   the gym--say a half hour to an hour before you are getting really
   active--makes sense.  Otherwise you risk what someone else reported on
   another thread I was reading earlier--after exercise, their blood sugar
   goes up. That is because if you trend low, burning up all your blood
   sugar, while exercising, the liver releases a boost of sugar into your
   blood, to fuel continued exertion, and often that is a bit much,
   leading to higher numbers after exercising. Those may or may not last
   very long, but can be avoided by moderate carb loading, such as the
   minimal increase you report in breakfast before exercise.


   The key to figuring it out is using your meter before, and after the
   exercise, and maybe even mid-way, depending on how long you are working
   out...

     Thanks, Ruth. I have 2 eggs along with the equivalent of 1 slice of
     whole wheat bread & the coffee with cream. I thought the fiber in
     the bread would keep BG from spiking. Since it is homemade bread, I
     have to estimate the nutrition, so I weighed it and use the
     nutrition info for Nature's Own whole wheat - which only has 11g
     carbs/28gr, so I thought that would be safe. I've noticed that
     sometimes it makes BG go up & sometimes it doesn't seem to. I'm
     trying to eat that only when I'm headed to the gym that morning,
     especially since I'm supposed to have more calories than what I was
     doing before (only eating the eggs & coffee w/cream, or sometimes
     I'd make an omelette with a veggie or crustless quiche with
     veggies). Maybe I should eat the crustless quiche before hitting the
     gym- it tends to be higher in calories than the eggs/coffee/toast
     combo and I estimate the carbs to be about 6g. Maybe when the
     meformin finally begins to kick in, I'll be able to eat the toast.
     It just gives some variety & fiber to breakfast.

   Hi, rainy,


   I like to buy Nature's Own (I like their whole grain bread myself)
   because it's 11 g carbs per slice, but that's lower than most breads,
   so I think it's not really a good idea to use that as a sort of
   baseline when estimating your homemade bread. Many breads have twice
   (or even more than twice) the carbs of Nature's Own.


   I also think it's important to keep in mind that pretty much any time
   you eat anything (but esp anything carby), your BG will go up. For most
   people, it's not a matter of trying to completely avoid any rise in BG.
   Some people try to control the amount of the rise (usually I've read
   that about 40 points is the maximum they like their BG to go up after
   meals). Others (like me) just aim for less than a certain BG number
   after meals (for me, it's under 160) rather than looking at how much it
   goes up from what it was before the meal. You might know all this
   already....
   Till next time,
