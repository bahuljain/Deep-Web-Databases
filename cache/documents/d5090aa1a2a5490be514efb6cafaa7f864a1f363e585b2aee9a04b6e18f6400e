   I've read that I can have between 60-70 carbs per meal, is this
   correct? Do I have to have this amount to keep my levels right? I'm
   newly diagnosed and very confused with what I can and can't have with
   Type 2 Diabetes? Any help would be much appreciated
   Thank you

   Welcome to the club.

   The only thing that I can advise you about the number of carbs you can
   eat per meal is to let your meter be your guide. Everyone of us is
   different and carbs effect us all differently.

   Can you answer some questions for us? Answering these questions will
   help us to help you better.

   How were you diagnosed?

   What were your numbers at time of diagnosis? What are they now?

   Are you on any medication(s)? If so, one(s) and what is the dosage?

   Hi and welcome.


   You might have read or even been told that by a medical professional,
   but my advise would be to ignore that and find out for yourself just
   how many carbs your body can handle without having very high numbers.


   It's very sad that people aren't taught this to begin with and many go
   through high numbers, complications and large amounts of medication
   following this advise.


   You are not a robot and one-size-fits-all really fits very few.  But
   here's a way to find out how many carbs you can handle, what to do and
   what to eat in addition to lots of other information.  Click on the

   Hi, Peter,


   Welcome to the site!


   James is right about letting your meter be your guide and we're all
   different.


   However, I'm guessing your numbers were pretty high when you were
   diagnosed, right? We know they were high ('cause you got the diagnosis!
   Smiley Wink ). With that in mind, for a lot of people, 60-70 carbs per
   meal would be pretty low compared to what they usually eat, so using
   that as a starting poing is not necessarily a bad idea. So...starting
   there and then adjusting as seems necessary to get/keep your BG in
   check is a good approach.


   One thing to keep in mind is that, being newly diagnosed, it's going to
   take a little while to get your numbers in check, esp. if they were
   very high when you were diagnosed. IMO, making healthy changes to your
   diet and exercise habits (and taking meds as prescribed--if they've
   been prescribed) is more important right now than worrying about
   specific numbers and constant testing.


   If you give us a few details about your situation (BG and/or A1c
   numbers, meds, diet, exercise), we can probably give you more specific
   and more helpful feedback.


   I wish you much luck and I hope you'll come back to the site
   regularly--all updates, questions, rants, etc. are welcome here!


   Here's a link to a chart for counting carbs, in case you don't have one
   already.


   \\[96]http://iuhealth.org/images/ril-doc-upl/Carbohydrat
   e%20Counting%20Food%20List.pdf


     * Notice that there are two lists for veggies: starchy and
       non-starchy. Personally, I eat as much as I want of the non-starchy
       veggies, but I limit the starchy ones (or avoid them completely and
       get my carbs elsewhere).
     * Also notice that much of the chart is about "servings." 1 serving =
       15 g carbs  That's on the chart, but I thought I'd point it out
       'cause it's so important.
     * If you eat any kind of packaged foods, go by what the package says
       in terms of the carbs, rather than by this chart.
     * Check out the "nurtition label" on the package which lists grams of
       carbs; don't go by the claims of "low carb" or "sugar free" (or
       anything like that) on the package.
     * Pay attention to the serving size listed on the package too--very
       important.

   Till next time,

   Hi Peter and welcome to the community!  Would you mind sharing a bit
   more about your diabetes; it helps us to help you?  What was your A1c
   at diagnosis, has your doctor given you any medications, did the doctor
   talk to you about diet or exercise?  Did they prescribe a blood glucose
   meter for you?


   We can help you with any questions you might have.  LizzyLou one of our
   long time members has written a blog to help those of us with diabetes
   and here is the section she has written for the newly diagnosed:
   [107]http://lizzysdlounge.com/2012/04/14/getting-started/.  Read the
   info and come back here with any questions you might have.


   On the amount of carbohydrate grams, that varies from person to
   person.  I can't eat more than 80 carb grams per day, much less 60 per
   meal.  You can determine that by learning to do what we call eating to
   your meter.  The amount of carbs can even vary from meal to meal.
   While some of us have high blood glucose from any grains, others do
   not.  Read the testing 101 section at Lizzy's blog, as well as the
   other info.  It will help you gain control and establish a meal plan
   that will work for you....we all have the same disease, but what works
   for one might not for another.


   Please feel free to ask any questions you may have and someone here
   will try to help.

   as everyone above has said, you need to find the level of carbs that
   works for you.  let your meter be your guide.


   i'd like to add, instead of starting with 60-70g carbs per meal and
   going down, i'd start low and go up.  for example, start with 20-30g
   per meal and see what it does to your blood sugar and adjust as needed.
    also, remember carbs from different foods can be handled differently
   by different people.  there are some who can eat a banana without
   having a spike, but others can't.


   i haven't seen many type 2's on this board that can handle 60-70g per
   meal unless they're also using insulin or they work out intensely.
   Dx T2 6/6/13 - A1c - 8.2, FBS - 143, 2hr PP - 181

   (5/30/14): A1c - 5.3 (12/03/14): A1c - 5.5 grrr...

   Even as a member of the work out intensely club, I rarely go over 50g a
   meal.


   Well except for "breakfast" but that's because that's a eat and then
   wait 2 hours and then eat and then work out and then eat post work out
   sort of thing which isn't the same as sitting down with 70 g.

   It depends on so many things -- your height, weight, gender, personal
   metabolism, exercise, and perhaps meds.  I started with the
   typically-recommended 60g carbs that my dietician started me out on,
   and it was fine for a while, because I was exercising frequently
   (although not intensely, because regular exercise was fairly new for
   me).  But as I built up my fitness level, lost weight, and the exercise
   became gradually easier for me, it also required me to reduce my carb
   grams while increasing my exercise minutes and intensity, in order to
   keep my BG level good and in normal range.  So, it was basically: add
   more exercise while subtracting more carbs -- all very gradually, while
   keeping an eye on my BG meter to tell me how many carb grams were too
   many, and how much exercise was too little.  Still, I feel that my
   Registered Dietician gave me a good start in her carb-counting and
   label-reading advice, how to incorporate just about any food into my
   plan, well-balanced meals and snacks, limiting portions, and spreading
   them out over the day and evening (I also spread my exercise out over
   the day and evening, and lost all 40 excess pounds while controlling my
   blood sugar).  So I recommend seeing an RD if your doctor can refer you
   to one.  You just have to find what works for you, and keep in mind
   that may gradually change over time.  Welcome, Peter ~ what do your

   Hi I'm on a carb to insulin ratio I can have 45 to 60 carbs per meal
   and for my snack its 15 carbs. I add my carbs up then divide them by 12
   and thats how much I give in insulin. This is set up by my nutritionist
   that I work with.

   MaryFran, how are your blood glucose levels doing eating that many
   carbohydrates?  It is different for those of us who do not use insulin
   and usually we need to restrict our carbs to much lower levels.  The
   important thing is that we all control our diabetes at levels where we
   are less likely to develop complications.
