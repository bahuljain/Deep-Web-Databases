Both AMD and Intel guilty of BenchMarketing

     This was a very intresting article that largely explained away the
     critism of the G5 Benchmarking technique.
     There are several statements about hyperthreading, SSE, etc that
     seem to indicate that these are purely marketing / benchmarketing
     strategies which should not ever be considered when comparing
     processor to processor.
     If you followed that logic, it almost puts AMD back on top as the
     true highest performer and knocks Intel down to nearly dead last.
     Very intresting read.
     Not at all dissimiliar to the recent benchmarking shattering news on
     video cards related to Nvidia and ATI.
     I hope sooner or later we can sift through all of the benchmarketing
     bull crap and get honest performance indicators.
     Reading the article really left me with the sick feeling in the pit
     of my stomach that even well respected reviewers like Anand are
     nothing more than puppets of Intel (and AMD) to do free advertising
     using benchmarks which are optimized using code that will never be
     realized in real world applications.
     Down right disturbing.
     After reading the article I am serioulsy considering re-reading
     every review since Ive read since about the 2.0 ghz mark and try and
     see who is really the best performer without all of the
     optimizations, but I pretty much alreay know the AMDser.
     Edit: Opps I forgot to post the link. Hehe

     For those too lazy to read here is the section I was largely
     referring to (although its better to read the whole thing).
     Benchmarks
     There has been a great deal of controversy over the benchmarks that
     Apple has published when it announced the new PPC 970 based G5 [10].
     The figures Apple gave for the Dell PC were a great deal lower than
     the figures presented on the SPEC website. Many have criticised
     Apple for this but all they did is use a different compiler (GCC)
     and this gave the lower x86 results. GCC may not be the best x86
     compiler but it contains a scheduler for neither the P4 or PPC 970
     however it is considerably more mature on x86 than PowerPC. In fact
     only very recently has the PowerPC code generation began to approach
     the quality of x86 code generation. GCC 3.2 for instance produced
     incorrect code for some PowerPC applications.
     However, this does lead to the question of why the SPEC scores
     produced by GCC are so different from those produced by Intel's ICC
     compiler which it uses when submitting SPEC results. Is ICC really
     that much better than GCC? In a recent test [11] of x86 compilers
     most results turned out glaringly similar but when SEE2 is activated
     ICC completely floors the competition. ICC is picking up the code
     and auto-vectorising it for the x86 SSE2 unit, the other compilers
     do not have this feature so don't get it's benefit. I think it's
     fairly safe to assume this at least in part is the reason for the
     difference between the SPEC scores produced by Apple and Intel.
     This was a set of artificial benchmarks but does this translate into
     real life speed improvements? According to this comment [12] by an
     ICC user the auto-vectorising for the most part doesn't make any
     difference as most code cannot be auto-vectorised.
     In the description of the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks the following is
     stated:
     "These benchmarks measure the performance of the processor, memory
     and compiler on the tested system."
     SPEC marks are generally used to compare the performance of CPUs
     however the above states explicitly this is not what they are
     designed for, SPEC marks also also test the compiler. There are no
     doubt real life areas where the auto-vectorisation works but if
     these are only a small minority of applications, benchmarks that are
     effected by it become rather meaningless since they do show reliably
     how most applications are likely to perform.
     Auto-vetorisation also work the other way, The PowerPCs Altivec unit
     is very powerful and benchmarks which are vectorised for it can show
     a G4 outperforming a P4 by up to 3 1/2.
     By using GCC Apple removed the compiler from the factors effecting
     system speed and gave a more direct CPU to CPU comparison. This is a
     better comparison if you just want to compare CPUs and prevents the
     CPU vendor from getting inflated results due to the compiler.
     x86 CPUs may use all the tricks in the book to improve performance
     but for the reasons I explained above they remain inefficient and
     are not as fast as you may think or as benchmarks appear to
     indicate. I'm not the only one to hold such an opinion:
     "Intel's chips perform disproportionately well on SPEC's tests
     because Intel has optimised its compiler for such tests"[13]* -
     Peter Glaskowsky, editor-in-chief of Microprocessor Report.
     I note that the term "chips" is used, I wonder does the same apply
     to the Itanium? This architecture is also highly sensitive to the
     compiler and this author has read (on more than one occasion) from
     Itanium users that it's performance is not what the benchmarks
     suggest.
     If SPEC marks are to a useful measure of CPU performance they should
     use the same compiler, an open source compiler is ideal for this as
     any optimisations added for one CPU will be in the source code and
     can thus be added to the other CPUs also keeping things rather more
     balanced.
     People accuse Apple of fudging their benchmarks, but everybody in
     the industry does it - and SPEC marks are certainly not immune, it's
     called marketing.
     Personally I liked the following comment from Slashdot which pretty
     much sums the situation up:
     "The only benchmarks that matter is my impression of the system
     while using the apps I use. Everything else is opinion." - FooGoo

     I think more than AMD and Intel are guilty of this. Once people
     started judging computer products by benchmarks (and believing them
     as the standard), the makers of these products began to exploit the
     benchmarks. Personally, I don't like the synthetics, as they aren't
     useful, real world apps, but it's just as easy to cheat for popular
     games/image editors all the same. I think much of this began with
     Intel exploiting clockspeed with the Willamette, but AMD made it
     worse with PR ratings (though not until the PR3000). ATi and nVidia
     have been questioned about cheating, and we all know how Apple
     plays. What seems to be the most painful truth is that consumers see
     what they want to see that helps support their purchase decision,
     but what else can we do since it's so hard to tell what the truth
     is? I think it's gotten to the point that no one really trusts the
     benchmarks, so manufacturers will make whatever claim they want, and
     the claims go largely unchallenged.

     Give what you cannot keep to gain what you cannot lose.

     What I have just figured out lately, and find quite interesting, is
     just how far AMD has stretched it's PR numbers for the AthlonXP
     lately.
     The first Athlon XP, the 1500+, ran at 1.33GHz, so the PR rating was
     112.5% of the core speed. Move forward to today and the XP3200+ has
     a PR rating 145.5% of the true 2.2GHz core speed!
     I know the platform has matured for the AthlonXP, and the first PR
     numbers were very conservative against the Willa-sucka-met P4 of the
     time, and the Athlon XP got 256KB more L2 cache, but the PR numbers
     have certainly moved up a lot.
     I think when Barton arrived, AMD started getting a bit desperate.
     Well, they were a bit desperate before that, having to create the
     Barton at all.
     Sounds strange, me having a dig at the Athlon I hope the Athlon64
     levels things out.
     Oh, and when I look at the reviews, I only really look at the FPS in
     the games and the encoding times for video. The rest is pure
     garbage.

     garbage.
     And even this is difficult to attribute a good analysis to. K8 is
     going to really blur the benchmark lines here. Games will run like a
     bad dog on this processor due to the very effecient link to the AGP
     bus and the low latency IMC. Since K8 still uses only DDR333 (and
     later DDR400) encoding times for video will likely stay behind the
     current P4 due to the huge deficit in bandwidth K8 still has behind
     P4.
     The author of this article hit on one thing I have been saying for
     quite some time...... Heat. According to the article:
     What is going to be a hurdle for x86 systems is heat. x86 CPUs
     already get hot and require considerable cooling but this is getting
     worse and eventually it will hit a wall. A report by the publishers
     of Microprocessor Report indicated that Intel is expected to start
     hitting the heat wall in 2004.
     I expect Intel to have signifigant issues with heat on Prescott. You
     simply can't add more and more heat to less and less area without
     running into cooling problems.
     AMD still has the x86 legacy to deal with. It still has the CISC to
     RISC decode step that RISC machines do not; however, it has a
     signifigantly smaller pipe than that of Intel and none of its
     transistors run at 2 times the processor speed like the P4. While I
     think the idea of running parts of the processor at higher clock is
     a sure way to increase performance, it will also produce more heat.
     Prescott is reputedly moving to an even longer pipe than Northwood.
     This decrease in IPC may well be offset by better hyperthreadding
     and larger L2 cache; however, even existing hyperthreadding causes
     P4 to run signifigantly hotter. Prescott is also reputed to increase
     the clock in more areas than just the ALU as Northwood has it. All
     of this makes more heat.

     With greater knowledge comes greater understanding!

     As horrible as X86 may be, I've watched it go head to head with, and
     eventually beat almost every other instruction set ever produced.
     The EV7, the IBM's Power series and the Itanium are literally all
     that is left of those once proud and lauded "better" designs.
     Furthermore, X86 has done all this without the benefit of a sealed,
     proprietary environment, or the benfits associated with high cost
     manufacture (Disgustingly large L2 and L3 caches are high on this
     list... the next Itanium will have 9 MB).
     If it is only 'compiler tricks' that make X86 deliver comperable
     performance at the merest fraction of the cost, so be it... let's
     use optimized compilers. I'm not at all adverse to using optimized
     compilers for benchmarks, as long as that optimization is reflected
     in the software developed for the platform. Example: I thought
     Intel/Sysmark using the "Lighting Effects" Filter in Photoshop to
     determine better than 35% of the 'score' was dishonest, because it
     does not represent a realistic usage scenerio. It is wrong because
     if someone bought the chip because of the performance in this app,
     their decision may have been skewed. However, the heavy use of SSE2
     today IS justified because software that uses it is readily
     available (and very common, even prevailent).
     As far as heat goes... What do you suggest OneEng? That we all toss
     our X86 chips and buy much slower Macs that run cooler? I'd just as
     soon buy a slower X86 chip that runs cooler.

     We all Think Different too.

     Benchmarketing is an issue, yes.
     For example, I was _very_ surprised to read that IBM's way of
     dealing with SPEC is to basically run it through a special
     "pre-compiler" which basically rewrites everything so it makes
     better use of their CPU details. (E.g., cache architecture, memory
     access patterns, etc.)
     While technically speakin the resulting program is an exact
     equivalent of the original, in terms of result produced for each set
     of result data, I doubt that they can apply the same level of
     optimization to any program that Random J Developper writes. I.e.,
     the results _will_ be skewed, compared to what you'll observe in
     real life scenarios.
     That said, I think Intel is actually pretty honest there. I am not
     aware of any special compiler tricks that Intel uses only for
     benchmarks. Both the Intel compiler and the theory behind it were
     always available for everyone, so a real life program _can_ and
     _does_ display the exact same performance boost as the benchmarks.
     For the end use it's the programs that count. Whether it runs fast
     because of the CPU alone, or because of the compiler alone, or both,
     means exactly _nothing_ to the end user. If I get, say, 100 fps in a
     game, that's it. That's what matters. If it was made possible only
     because they used Intel's compiler, I couldn't care less.
     So in the end the CPU and the compiler are two halves of the same
     whole. You can't really separate them and say "see, without that
     half it runs slower, so Intel (or AMD) sucks."
     It would be like trying to separate the CPU proper from the cache
     and saying "yeah, but without the cache, the Intel is slower." Well
     who cares? Noone uses a P4 without a cache, so that's irrelevant.
     Ditto for the compiler. Noone uses a CPU without a compiler. It's
     the sum of the two that really matters.
     Which brings us to what Apple did. Actually it's not Intel who
     cheated there, it's Apple who cheated in those benchmarks. On a
     cheating scale, using a crappier compiler for the P4 is no better
     than disabling half a P4s cache or half its memory bandwidth.
     It reflects real life scenarios... how? How many major Windows
     programs are compiled with gcc? Exactly zero.
     It's like in a hypothetical scenario saying "but our CPU doesn't
     have a L2 cache, so we disabled the L2 cache on the P4 too, to
     compare everything on equal terms." Well, no, it's not comparing on
     equal terms, it's deliberately crippling one competitor. It's
     cheating.
     Basically it's sad. If Apple needs to resort to this kind of lies
     and BS to sell its computers... well, my opinion of Apple dropped a
     long way.

     True; however, one could argue that the vast majority of apps are
     compiled using JUST MS Visual Studio and NOT the Intel compiler
     plugin. There are some that do use the plug-in or outright use the
     Intel compiler; however, MOST do not. That being said, it is true
     that SSE2 is now becomming widely used. I do not see the use of this
     instruction set as being unfair in any way.
     Hoyle,
     While I agree with what you said, it is an undisputed fact that the
     RISC design is simply a better one. If 1/10th the effort was put
     into compiler optimizations for RISC as it is for x86, RISC would be
     untouchable.
     As far as performance goes, x86 has managed to catch up to all but
     the FP performance of RISC. It has done so by using all the
     fundamental designs that RISC uses and by actually BEING RISC in
     most of its digital design.
     RISC designs have a bizzillion general purpose registers. RISC
     designs have no need to decode instructions into RISC since they
     start out that way. RISC designs do not rely on the arcaine x86
     stack based FP unit.
     All of these factors give RISC a huge advantage from a hardware
     standpoint. Just as I contend that P4's core design idea is junk,
     x86's core design is just as flawed. Both of these examples have
     managed to bandaid their weakness with an array of great periferial
     ideas that have perfomed exceedingly well. Emagine how well RISC
     would perform given the same periferial advantages as CISC in its
     compiler and FSB, etc, etc.
     As far as heat goes... What do you suggest OneEng? That we all toss
     our X86 chips and buy much slower Macs that run cooler? I'd just as
     soon buy a slower X86 chip that runs cooler.
     You are missing the point.
     You can't just pretend that the heat issue isn't there. I am sure
     Intel is finding that out as we speak. You can't just pack more and
     more heat into less and less area and expect the engineers just to
     "come up with something" to keep it going.
     If you build a house on a bad foundation, you will inevitably have
     to tear it down, replace the foundation, and rebuild it.
     Having said this, I truely believe that water cooling will be
     comming to save Intel for the next 5 years. A water cooling solution
     should provide Intel with heat removal capabilities sufficient to
     scale their designs on .09um and .065um. Beyond that they may be in
     trouble again.
     AMD lies somewhere between RISC and P4 in its heat problems. K8 on
     SOI is a fairly cool running design. Higher IPC means that it
     doesn't have to scale as high in clock speed which further aids it
     in the battle against heat.
     When Prescott is released at the end of this year (we hope), we
     should get a really good idea about how much of a problem heat
     really is at .09um for Intel.

     With greater knowledge comes greater understanding!

     Good points to be certain.
     I was simply looking at it from the fact that while the range of
     arguments given for the compilier have gone from "very little" to
     "common" to "prevalant" exactly what does that do for the
     performance of software that isnt using it? Misleading to be sure.

     However:
     1) there are entire Linux distributions compiled with Intel's
     compiler (e.g., Mandrake.) So it's not like noone uses that compiler
     in real life situations.
     2) In practice it doesn't matter that much if non-critical stuff,
     like web browsers and dialog boxes are compiled with MSVC, because
     those aren't what you need a fast computer for. The stuff which
     really needs speed, e.g., codecs or the rendering loop in games, is
     typically hand optimized assembly which _does_ use those
     instructions.
     3) MSVC isn't that bad at generating code either.
     However, ok, your point is noted. If that Apple test had used MSVC
     for x86, I could see the merit it that comparison. But gcc?

     As for the RISC philosophy, well, it seems to me like:
     A) The whole RISC detour was a dead end anyway. When you had tens of
     thousands of transistors as a total budget for a CPU, yes, you had a
     touch choice. You had enough transistors either for a CISC control
     unit, or you could have more registers instead, but not both.
     But today that aspect is irrelevant. You can have a _lot_ of CISC
     logic and still have plenty of space left for an 128 or 256 register
     stack.
     And indeed, even the so called RISC processors today are in fact
     _not_ RISC any more. Or at least they're not even near what the
     original RISC philosophy was like. Today it's more like a buzzword
     than anything meaningful.
     B) The whole RISC architecture was good and fine, but it also
     created its own disadvantages.
     For a start the generated code was _huge_, compared to CISC code.
     Stuff which could be packed in 1 byte or 2 bytes for a CISC CPU,
     still needed the whole command word for a RISC CPU. Worse yet, it
     often needed several command words in a true RISC CPU. What does it
     mean in practice? They created their own bandwidth problem.
     That's the kind of difference that happens between stuff which looks
     good on paper, and stuff which happens in practice.
     C) If you think about what RISC originally meant, it was precisely
     about a philosophy along the lines of "don't do in hardware what the
     compiler can do for you." Most of the complexity was offloaded to
     the compiler, while the CPU used the freed transistors to provide
     lots of registers and generally enough rope for the compiler to hang
     itself with.
     What's Intel doing nowadays? Well, it's doing precisely that.
     So from this point of view, the x86 architecture nowadays is
     actually more RISC than some proclaimed RISC CPUs.
     So if I'm to summarize all this, what I'm saying is that today there
     are no more RISC and CISC CPUs as such. Yes, the x86 archtecture
     could be designed better from scratch, if someone were to re-design
     it from scratch for today's technology. Unfortunately, we're stuck
     with a register and command architecture designed over 20 years ago,
     for a 16 bit CPU with very few transistors in it. That's the real
     problem, not whether that original CPU was RISC or CISC.
