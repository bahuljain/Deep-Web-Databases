Stay Healthy This Tailgating Season!

   It’s almost fall, which means the excitement of football season is in
   the air. For many of us, the upcoming weekends are bound to be filled
   with game watches, spirited barbeques, and all-day tailgates. These
   events can be tons of fun, but with them comes an abundance of tempting
   snacks, over-sized burgers, and rich desserts…not exactly ideal for
   someone who is trying to lose weight or control their diabetes.

   Don’t let the traditionally fatty foods and alcoholic beverages
   consumed on game day take the fun out of your celebration. To help you
   out, we’re bringing you lots of tailgating tips so you can navigate the
   food and drink situation more easily this season.

Offer to Bring Something or Organize

   First off, always offer to contribute to the party! Bring something
   healthy that you know you can eat and others will enjoy. If you can,
   volunteer to organize the tailgate or host your fellow fans at your
   place to watch the game. That way, you’ll have more control over the
   options on the table. (Make sure you assign someone to bring fruit and
   a salad!)

   The host of the party is typically responsible for the main dish. Buy
   lean turkey or beef to make burgers instead of higher-fat ground beef.
   It's likely your guests won't even notice! Or, mix it up and go with
   some [13]barbecued chicken or kabobs with chicken and veggies.

   To give yourself and your guests more healthy choices, put out some
   healthy side and snack options. Some good ideas are a tomato and
   cucumber salad, veggie tray, fruit salad, or unsalted trail mix.

Think Healthy Grilling

   Barbeque grub doesn’t have to be fat-laden or sauce-heavy. There are a
   lot of ways to add nutritional value and lighten up traditional
   tailgating foods:
     * Bring some lean meat patties to the party (93% lean - or more -
       ground turkey or beef is best).
     * Opt for healthy burger fixings like avocado, tomato, and lettuce.
     * Forgo the cheese to save about 100 calories and at least 5 grams of
       saturated fat.
     * Whole wheat buns are easy to find, so pick some up for next week’s
       party.
     * Stick to mustard, which is lower in calories and carbs than
       ketchup.
     * If opting for brats, sausages, or hot dogs, choose those that have
       less than 3 grams of fat per ounce.
     * If beef is your meat of choice, choose a leaner cut like sirloin,
       t-bone, or flank steak.
     * Try sliders instead of full-size burgers – buy mini buns or whole
       wheat rolls and fill them with mini meat patties, small steaks, or
       barbecued chicken. Better yet, try our [14]Healthy Mexican Sliders.
     * Grill up some chicken kabobs but include some zucchini squash,
       peppers, and onions on each skewer.
     * Keep the idea of a [15]healthy chili or stew in your back pocket
       for the colder months of football season. Pack extra veggies into
       your chili and opt for lean protein like chicken or lean ground
       beef. Our Veggie Chili is another hearty choice that your guests
       will love!

Over-Snacking – How to Beat It!

   Tailgates and football parties typically center around a spread of
   endless snacks and treats. With a dozen or so dips, chips, and baked
   goods to choose from, it’s easy to graze and overeat.

   But easy on the chips, pretzels, and cookies – they’re dense in
   calories and carbs, and also low in nutrients. There are so many other
   nutritious, yet tasty sides and snacks to choose from. Here are some
   options that you might find on the table or that you can bring to the
   party yourself:
     * A veggie tray with healthy dips like low-fat ranch dressing,
       guacamole, and hummus
     * Healthy slaw or a side salad like our [17]Asian Kale Slaw or
       [18]Brussels Sprouts Slaw
     * [19]Black Bean and Corn Salad
     * Fruit salad or fruit skewers
     * Layered taco dip that has been individually portioned in plastic
       cups with whole grain chips
     * Salsa with baked tortilla chips (¼ cup of salsa is considered a
       free food!)
     * Unbuttered popcorn
     * A plate arranged with whole grain crackers and cheese cubes
     * Try some of our featured recipes for the month of September:
       [20]Peanut Butter Banana Oat Balls, [21]Baked Hot Wings with Lime
       Cilantro Sauce, [22]Roasted and Spiced Chick Peas, or our
       [23]Curried Sweet Potato Dip with Crunchy Pita Chips

   More tips for tighter snacking control:

   For many people, the “out of sight, out of mind” tactic works. Park
   your folding chair away from the food table. Focus on the game and put
   your energy into cheering on your team and catching up with friends.

   Take a small appetizer plate and fill it with the snacks you’ll have at
   the party. Keep in mind your meal plan and portion sizes. Resist going
   back for seconds and eat your snacks slowly so you really enjoy them!

   It can also help you and others when you provide the nutrition
   information for any dish that you bring. Guests can use it to check
   portion sizes and carbohydrate counts!

The Alcohol Factor

   Good food is a must when you’re tailgating, but you should also expect
   to encounter a sizeable selection of [24]alcoholic beverages. Whether
   or not to drink can be a challenging issue for those who are watching
   their weight or managing diabetes. If you have diabetes and want to
   drink alcohol, here are a few steps to take to make sure you stay safe
   on game day:
     * Check with your health care team about whether it is safe for you
       to drink alcohol. For example, if you have neuropathy, drinking
       alcohol can worsen your symptoms.
     * Always eat food if you drink an alcoholic beverage.  Don’t drink on
       an empty stomach. Alcohol is processed differently than food and
       can cause low blood glucose levels.  Because of the calories in
       alcoholic beverages, many people try to cut back on their food
       intake.  This is a mistake and can increase your risk of severe
       hypoglycemia – particularly if you take insulin or a pill that
       lowers blood glucose levels.
     * Stick to no more than 2 drinks or less per day for men and 1 drink
       or less per day for women.  (A drink is 12 ounces of beer, 1 ½
       ounces of distilled spirits or 5 oz of wine.)
     * To stay safe, check your blood glucose levels to see how alcohol
       affects you.
     * Keep in mind that any alcohol you drink can cause you to make poor
       decisions when it comes to your diet. You can still enjoy a drink
       or two, but stay in control and do your best to make healthy
       choices.

   Alcoholic drinks can also be high in calories, and they’ll add up
   quickly when you have more than one drink. Stay away from sugary mixers
   and drinks like punch, margaritas, and heavy beers. Some lighter
   options to consider are light beer or wine spritzers.

   You should also make sure non-alcoholic drinks are available. Whether
   it’s Crystal Light lemonade or diet soda, bring your favorite
   [25]zero-calorie drink so you have another beverage option.

Take a Half-Time Fitness Break

   If you go to a friend’s house to watch the big game, take advantage of
   the break at half-time. Use that time to get up and move around a bit.
     * Grab a buddy and head out for a walk
     * Get the group together for a pickup football game in the yard
     * Help your host clear some plates and clean a few dishes in the
       kitchen

   If you’re tailgating in anticipation of watching the game live, don’t
   forget to bring your own football to the party. Instead of spending the
   whole tailgate eating, drinking, and sitting in a camping chair, make
   an effort to get up and walk around every few minutes. Walk around the
   parking lot to check out some of the other tailgates or play some catch
   with another fellow fan.

   Football season doesn’t have to be the off-season for your healthy
   diet. There are many ways you can put a healthy spin on your tailgate
   or game watch. Be sure to check out this month’s [26]recipes, on-the-go
   tips, and our [27]sample meal plan to see how you can stay healthy this
   season!
