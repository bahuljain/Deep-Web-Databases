Thumbs up [RESOLVED] Windows Problem - helpctr.exe virus?

     Windows Problem - helpctr.exe virus? process keeps spawning dozens
     of windows.
     Im having an extremely irritating problem right now involving this
     process "helpctr.exe".
     I only started receiving this issue after i installed the latest 2
     windows updates. One was as security patch and the next was the
     windows malicious file remover update. I believe this issue started
     right after the first security patch because when i came back to my
     machine after awaking I noticed the issue (nothing had been running
     and my machine was idle and connected to aim/icq/skype as usual).
     Afterwards i installed the second patch which initiated MRT.exe and
     once that initiated my normal virus scanner popped up indicating
     there was a virus associated with a "senses.dll" which would be
     removed after reboot. I had to reboot because the amount of
     helpctr.exe processes filled my taskbar 10x and eventually froze my
     machine. As far as i know senses.dll was deleted after rebooting as
     i was unable to find it. I dont know whether or not it has anything
     to do with this issue or not.
     Here is whats happening.
     After booting up my machine and attempting to load anything or even
     click on the desktop a help file will load for whatever app i have
     opened up at that time. It keeps respawning over and over after i
     kill the processes. Eventually it stops for a while then after my
     machine is sitting for a while it respawns again.
     Process = helpctr.exe, ive noticed it sometimes loads other help and
     support related exe's as well such as helpsvc.exe, winhlp32.exe and
     helphost.exe.
     Another box pops up displaying "Help and support error - Windows
     cannot open help and support becuase a system service is not
     running. To fix this problem, start the service named " Help and
     Support:" - Every time i click x or ok it respawns again and keeps
     cascading across my desktop. I have to click it over 20-60 times
     before it will stop. When this happens a helpfile box pops up and is
     almost always present at the top left of my screen.
     I cannot click on anything or run anything without the problem
     occuring. Whatever it is seems to take control over my keyboard as
     it seems. For example when i try to run netstat from cmd prompt it
     will show ZERO connections and then a white/pinkish screen pops up
     displaying the commands i just input. Im unable to type anything and
     sometimes when i attempt to backspace it just repeats what ive typed
     and im unable to complete it.
     Another thing ive found weird is when i load up firefox Caret
     Browsing attempts to initate and gives me a prompt saying i can
     press f7 to enable/disable. I have to litterally click the x button
     or cancel over 50 times before it will disapear and most of the time
     it doesnt. REgardless im still unable to use firefox.
     Right now im attempting to scan using trend micros online scanner
     via IE 7. I cannot run my normal virus scanning software because the
     help file issue ends up closing it after so many instances are
     opened. I should have results from this in another 4 hours or so if
     i dont continue having any more issues.
     What have i tried to fix this? (none have worked)
     I have tried
     1) Deleting all instances from the below directories. Which does no
     good because they recreate of course.
     C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch
     C:\WINDOWS\pchealth\helpctr\binaries
     C:\WINDOWS\pchealth\helpctr\System\Remote
     Assistance\Interaction\Common
     C:\WINDOWS\pchealth\helpctr\System\sysinfo
     2) I have navigated to C;\Windows\inf\pchealth.inf and attempted
     reinstalling. It will get maybe a 3rd of the way through then it
     wont even recognize the files from my i386 folder from my windows xp
     pro sp2 install cd. The files ARE present yet it says they arent and
     wont copy. I attempt deleting the files from
     C:\WINDOWS\pchealth\helpctr\binaries and then selecting "retry" but
     it doesnt help becuase they recreate.
     3) Checking msconfig and using an alternate bootload app to see if
     anything strange is loading up and nothing is.
     4) Disabling and enabling the help and support service
     5) Running my software virus scanners but im unable to even do this
     due to helpctr.exe respawning
     *Am I running an antivirus? Yes, i run nod32 constantly and its up
     to date.
     *Am i behind a firewall? Yes, im behind a router.
     *Is my machine upto date with the latest service pack and updates?
     Yes
     I cant seem to find anything new that relates to this issue. All i
     can find when searching is related to past issues that SP1 took care
     of.
     Any ideas what is causing this or if its a virus? Its certainly not
     something normal and shouldnt be happening.
     Thanks Kindly

     Just finished running through trend micros house call and it found a
     few low level viruses but nothing major.
     After this i went through and
     1) checked and cleaned registry
     2) cleared all temp files
     3) ran checkdisk
     I rebooted and after windows loaded up i immediately got this popup
     -
     "HELPCTR.EXE
     Windows cannot find "helpctr.exe". Make sure you typed the name
     correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start
     button, and then click Search."
     I closed it and about 2 mins later it popped back up again.
     Ive checked whats loading with my system and this file isnt loading.
     (i checked under msconfig and using another app that will show
     hidden files)
     I just opened command prompt and attempted to run netstat and again
     i got the same pink/grey box displayed on top of the cmd window that
     shows 0: netstat -a. Again i cannot type any other commands and can
     only close the cmd prompt window out.
     Below is a screenshot of the cmd prompt issue:
     (i cant replicate it again but when it occurs ill post it)
     Just loaded firefox and again received the same popup and when i
     select "No" it will not go away. Im able to switch between tabs
     though and im able to type urls in, type on webpages etc but the box
     stays on top still. Also the titlebar of the firefox browser window
     is blinking like crazy almost like something is taking control of
     commands. After about clicking X on the popup 200 times it went away
     and the title bar stopped blinking. Following is the popup:
     "CARET BROWSING
     Pressing F7 turns Caret Browsing on or off. This feature places a
     moveable cursor on web pages, allowing you to select text with the
     keyboard. Do you want to turn Caret Browsing on?
     Yes / No "
     So far the other problems havent occured and im running through
     various apps on the machine as i type this. Regardless its evident
     there are still problems as i shouldnt be receiving that popup after
     booting, the firefox issues and the issue with cmd prompt.
     ------
     After typing the above i have loaded up cmd prompt and im not having
     the issues. (i have IE open, firefox open, windows search running
     and also windows explorer open)
     I just happened to look over and navigate back to firefox and the
     popup has popped up again along with the title bar blinking like
     crazy and this time i cannot navigate around or type anything. I
     then switched to cmd prompt which i left open and... the issue is
     there again. I closed it out and typed just a basic command to show
     what im reffering to. Here is a screenshot:
     I just tried taking a screenshot of the various helpctr.exe files i
     found but received this error after pasting into irfanview and i
     cannot get the box to go away:
     "clipboard01 - Warning: this file is already deleted/moved. The file
     doesnt exist !"
     So i just loaded up an alternate application instead which is
     paint.net and i noticed similar activity to what was happening with
     firefox, only instead of just the applications title bar blinking
     one of my window panels within the application was blinking like
     crazy and im unable to click on anything when it stops blinking.
     However when it blinks i can select things. More proof to me that
     something odd is taking over my kb and executing some kind of
     commands.
     I was able to get a screenshot finally and below are the different
     versions of helpctr.exe. Anyone know which would be correct?
     So far it almost seems to me like something is executing commands
     which are screwing up the programs and causing these issues but im
     not sure.
     Any ideas anyone?

     Figured it might be an issue with an old usb hub ive been using and
     or its cable so i removed it.
     Powered on machine and had zero issues... Loaded up firefox, no
     issue. Loaded up a few other apps and seemed A-ok.. 10 minutes later
     i received a help popup on one of the apps i had open and.. all the
     same problems are happening again.
     Trying alternate usb ports, then if no luck, a new kb.

     Ran at least 4 other online virus scanners, a BHO scanner and a
     spyware scanners. Nothing detected. Ran 2 software based virus
     scanners. Nothing detected. Machine was running IE and a few apps
     fine while idling the past 4 hours and just now the problems started
     to occur again. I noticed this time when i opened an image directly
     (utilizing irfanview) a random option dialog box opened every time
     instead of a help file. However with other apps the same problems
     are occuring.
     I use a logitech G15 keyboard and logitech media play cordless mouse
     along with logitechs setpoint application.

     No problems letting it run over night. But again i only had a few
     things open such as firefox, IE and my virus scanner. I imagine ill
     start having issues again shortly, though i hope not.
     I still havent switched usb ports or my keyboard. I did however
     update the logitech keyboard and mouse drivers.

     Is it the machine in your sig?
     Have you looked at the motherboard for leaking or bulging
     capacitors?

     Its not the machine in my sig (i need to remove that sig, ive
     totally stayed away from gigabyte mobo's due to all the problems i
     had with that specific board and another).
     Board im running in the machine is an older board, Asus A7N8X-X. It
     has the latest bios and updates. Im running the latest nforce driver
     package(including the IDE controllers).
     When i swapped out nic's and a video card last week i took a look
     over the board front and back and didnt notice anything. I just took
     a look over the front now and none of the capacitors look to be
     bulging or leaking.
     Since the machine is still running (trying to push it as hard as
     possible to see if the problems occur again) i still havent tried
     alternate usb ports or swapped out the keyboard. To me it seems like
     something hardware related however i dont have anything thats bad as
     far as i know, and how the keyboard was still able to type during
     some of the issues makes me think its not the KB its self sending
     those commands.

     I was just checking Application issues under event viewer and I did
     notice a ton of logged events for "HHCTRL"
     Description:
     The description for Event ID ( 1904 ) in Source ( HHCTRL ) cannot be
     found.
     The local computer may not have the necessary registry information
     or
     message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer. You
     may be
     able to use the /AUXSOURCE= flag to retrieve this description; see
     Help and

     [105]http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=45840.
     Viewing the link it appears to be related to a vulnerability in heml
     help. However its older and my windows updates should have had that
     patched already. I also found some mentioning about issues with MS
     office 03 and vulnerabilities in MS Access which i use. Just
     yesterday I removed that version though and installed windows Office
     07 on the machine. I cant recall though if i was receiving any
     problems after i did this.
     Under System in event viewer i do notice i had a bunch of DCOM
     errors and during the time those were happening there was also
     numerous events of Application Popup desribing that helpctr.exe
     failed to initialize.
     DCOM Error:
     DCOM got error "The service cannot be started, either because it is

     some additional Application Popup errors that were also occuring -
     Application popup: hh.exe - Application Error : The application
     failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142). Click on OK to terminate
     the application.
     For more information, see Help and Support Center at

     for some reason there were also some identical to the above only
     iexplore.exe was capitalized (whether or not that means anything i
     dont know)

     ok...wow.. what a mess!!!
     first off, i know u ran a virus scan, but did u run ad-aware and
     spybot to check for malware???
     try zonealarm, it will tell u what program is attempting to launch
     without permission.
     disconnect from the internet when all the pop ups start and see what

     Tell me about it, definately a huge mess. :-[ . Has been driving me
     nuts all weekend.
     I ran adaware and a few other adware elimination programs and also
     malware detecting programs. Ive found a few small nasties but
     nothing major since i usually keep all machines at home and office
     up to date and clean. Im still running through various scanners now
     to see if anything is picked up or apps im runing are potentially
     vulnerable.
     I run process and port monitoring software on all machines and so
     far ive not noticed anything out of the ordinary. Of course if its a
     new rogue virus thats injecting itself into a common process im
     almost SOL until i can single it out or it gets picked up and added
     to virus dat tables.
     One of the first things i did was take the machine offline when all
     of the issues started happening. They were still occuring so i ruled
     out the issue being something remotely controlled.
     One of the first things i tried was manually replacing windows help
     using the .inf and trying a few other methods but none seemed to fix
     it. I took a look at the fix you linked and just applied it,
     *crossing fingers* now. I notice the author mentions "easy cleaner".
     I wonder which "easy cleaner" application hes reffering to. I do use
     "Toni Arts - Easy Cleaner" most of the time but its never caused any
     issues at all and ive been using it for years.
     Thanks whutsupdoc. Great site btw, lots of handy tips there. Adding
     it to my favorites.

     I just had the machine powered down and open to reseat my PCI usb
     hub and add another harddrive. I also reconnected my usb self
     powered usb hub and connected it to a different port on my machine,
     (i dont think this could be causing the issue because it was present
     even after i removed it last time). I powered it back on and all
     seemed to be well. I moved some data around, formatted the new
     drive. Created some partitions..
     Then after having an application open.... It started happening
     again. First the help file then within a few seconds the taskbard
     was filled with over 200 popups of the following (same as before)
     HELP AND SUPPORT ERROR
     Windows cannot open Help and Support because a system service is not
     running.
     To fix this problem, start the service named "Help and Support".
     When this is happening if i happen to click the desktop i get this
     error (same as before)
     HELPCTR.EXE
     Windows cannot find "helpctr.exe". Make sure you typed the name
     correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start
     button, and then click Search.
     Enabling Help and Support doesnt fix the issue, and the Help and
     Support service isnt something required for normal machine
     operation. (I always leave it disabled).
     Took machine offline and the issue is still respawning boxes. I
     opened up cmd prompt again and the same issues as before.. Only i
     noticed this time after i hit enter, the last command typed is
     automatically retyped, but only instead of instantly appearing its
     retyped out slowly. This could be lag from all the boxes which are
     opened and keeping opening, but i dont think so. Its similar to what
     happens when you press the up arrow key in cmd or a terminal window,
     only its not instant and appears as if it was retyped. If i hit
     enter it displays the command as usual then retypes itself again. If
     i hit space im able to space over one and type anything, backspace
     etc. Only i cannot backspace past the initial space. Im basically
     stuck at the end of the last command if i try that.
     Upon checking event log..
     Again there are hundreds of the same DCOM events and between the
     last burst the same Application Popup error describing helpctr.exe
     only i notice its "HelpCtr.exe" this time. The H and C are
     capitalized.
     DCOM got error "The service cannot be started, either because it is
     disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. "
     attempting to start the service helpsvc with arguments "" in order
     to run the server:
     {833E4010-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE}
     For more information, see Help and Support Center at
     [143]http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.

     Application popup: HelpCtr.exe - Application Error : The application
     failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142). Click on OK to terminate
     the application.

     I just deleted the contents of : c:\Documents and
     Settings\<USERNAME>\Application Data\Microsoft\HTML Help\. I then
     went into registry and edited the values for this key -
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
     Paths\HELPCTR.EXE - (there was no value at all for the entry, simply
     blank)
     Just ran hijackthis again and still nothing out of the ordinary
     found.
     Ran adsspy and found no unordinary streams at least to my knowledge.
     (it did however list a large amount of my favorites)
     Ran bholist and found not new rogue BHO's.
     Ran startuplist and went through checking everything, couldnt find
     anything.
     Ran spybot and came across some new entries (updated db this time).
     Removed those.
     Problem is still happening.
     This issue is a true pain in the @ss. Its definately at the top of
     my list of the worst problems ive had to resolve the past 6 months
     on machines.

     I'm not expert in dealing with these issues, but I'd be tempted to
     boot into safe mode and choose a restore point prior to that windows
     update, if you still have one available.

     Well.. I finally switched keyboards. Im going to feel like a
     complete idiot if it turns out the KB was at fault. Though i guess
     this thread will help anyone else who has this issue as ive covered
     and tried almost everything i could find regarding the subject.
     When the problems started happening again i unplugged my keyboard
     (its USB) and i noticed they stopped. I switched usb ports, waited
     for the problem to occur again and this time waited a bit long
     before pulling it. Repeated the process a few more times to make
     sure it wasnt lucky timing with w/e is causing it. Im running a
     different keyboard now (ps/2 type) and so far nothing has happened.
     If it turns out its the KB ill attempt to clean it and if that
     fails.. RMA.
     If it doesnt turn out to be the KB my next step is going back to a
     previous restore point like youve suggested Since I cant boot into
     safemode anymore. System stalls on one of the sys files it loads.
     BTNHmanager.sys or something of the like. I believe its a boot
     manager i installed a while back, just havent looked into it yet.
