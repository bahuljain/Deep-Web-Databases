   Best Answer:  If you want to take AGP as far as it will go, then you
   want the ATI Radeon HD3850 AGP.
   [121]http://www.newegg.ca/Product/ProductList...
   If you want a card more powerful than that, you'd have to upgrade to a
   whole new PCIExpress computer. The HD3850 is the very last and best AGP
   card made, before everybody moved on to PCIExpress.

       As of 2009[update], few new motherboards feature AGP slots. No new
       motherboard chipsets are equipped with AGP support, but
       motherboards continue to be produced with older chipsets that have
       AGP support. PCI Express allows for higher data transfer rates, has
       more robust full-duplex support, and also supports other devices.
       All new graphics processors are designed for PCI-Express. To create
       AGP graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe to AGP
       bridge chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This
       incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional
       bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board.
       Various manufacturers of graphics cards continue to produce AGP
       cards for the shrinking AGP user-base. The first bridged cards were
       the GeForce 6600 and ATI Radeon X800 XL boards, released during
       2004-5.[11][12] As of early 2009, AGP cards from Nvidia have a
       ceiling of the GeForce 7 series (despite the existence of a AGP
       version of a GeForce 8400[13] card, no manufacturer has made a
       comparable one for AGP systems). AMD's only official DirectX
       10-capable AGP cards are from ATI's Radeon HD 2400 and 2600 budget
       and mid-range lines.
       As of 2009, several manufacturers released AGP cards based on the
       mid-range Radeon HD3650 and the mid-high end HD3850.
       In March 2009, PowerColor released two midrange AGP cards based on
       the latest technology - the HD4650 and HD4670.
       [124]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated...
       Source(s): I cant seem to find an AGP HD4650 or 4670 on powercolor
       website but they have an AG3850
       and
       nvidia has a 7600 gs AGP
       those are probably the best of whats left

       you look like you'd be stuck with an ati x1650, not a burner by any
       stretch i've owned one (paired with a 2.2ghz athalon and 1 gig of
       ram it can play oblivion). If you have an agp slot and game it's
       time for an upgrade anyway, save your pennies and buy a new mobo,
       cpu, ram, and pci-e video card (hopefully you can reuse your psu,
       hdd, optical drive and case). For 300-400 usd you will be set for
       the next few years.
       *edit If you are still looking I just upgraded a system and have a
       x1650pro agp card, You can have it, otherwise it goes in the trash.

       This card looks pretty good and it will run any of the games you
       listed at high specs. It should even run new games at at least
       medium specs.
