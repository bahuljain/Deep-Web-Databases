An 8x AGP card in a 4x slot?

   I have an AK32 mainboard with a 4x AGP Graphics card slot. Will a AGP
   8x graphics card work ok in this slot? What is the difference between
   an 8x and a 4x?

   Best Answer:  Hi there!
   I have looked on the shuttle.com website, found your motherboard,
   downloaded the manual, read the listed specifications, and can't
   really give you a definitve answer.
   Thank you so much for providing the model number of your unit !
   The problem with saying " YES " you can put in ANY 8x AGP card is that
   your manual does not clearly state the specification to the keys and
   voltages that are used on its version of the 4X AGP, and you
   did not provide the information on EXACTLY which 8X AGP you are going
   to install.
   There is a simple explanation of the " standard" AGP slots, voltages,
   keys, and compatabilities here:
   ______________________________________...
   website link [120]http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Conne...
   AGP Bus Description
   AGP [Accelerated Graphics Port] is a Point-to-Point [Chip-to-Chip] bus
   using 1.5 Volt or 3.3V signaling. The main use of the AGP bus is as a
   Local Video bus in IBM compatible Personal Computers [PCs]. The AGP
   interface bus is based on the PCI [Peripheral Component Interface]
   spec, using the PCI specification as an operational baseline. The AGP
   specification adds 20 additional signals not included in the PCI bus.
   The AGP specification defines the Protocol, Electrical and Mechanical
   aspects of the bus. Refer to this page for a comparison of Video bus
   through-put for different expansion buses.
   The Mechanical definitions include a connector and AGP Board [Add-in
   card]. The Card sizes and 1.5v and 3.3v connectors are also defined
   within the spec. There are five connectors defined: AGP 3.3v, AGP 1.5v,
   AGP Universal, AGP Pro Universal, AGP Pro 3.3v, and AGP Pro 1.5v. PCI
   and AGP boards are not mechanically interchangeable.
   The AGP 1.0 specification defined 1x and 2x speeds with the 3.3v keyed
   connector.
   The AGP 2.0 specification defined 1x, 2x and 4x speeds with the 3.3v,
   or 1.5v keyed connector or a 'Universal' connector which supported both
   card types.
   The AGP Pro specification defined 1x, 2x and 4x speeds with the 3.3v,
   or 1.5v keyed connector or a 'Universal' connector which supported both
   card types.
   The AGP 3.0 specification defined 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x speeds with the
   1.5v keyed connector or a 1.5v AGP Universal / Pro connector.
   Each up-grade is a supper-set of the 1x mode, so 4x will also support
   the 1x speed. The base clock rate is 66MHz, but to achieve to 2x, 4x,
   and 8x speeds the clock is doubled each time. AGP uses both edges of
   the clock to transfer data.
   AGP (1x): 66MHz clock, 8 bytes/clock, Bandwidth: 266MB/s [3.3V or 1.5V
   signal swing]
   AGP 2x: 133MHz clock, 8 bytes/clock, Bandwidth: 533MB/s [3.3V or 1.5V
   signal swing]
   AGP 4x: 266MHz clock, 16 bytes/clock, Bandwidth: 1066MB/s [1.5V signal
   swing]
   AGP 8x: 533MHz clock, 32 bytes/clock, Bandwidth: 2.1GB/s [0.8V signal
   swing], still uses 1.5 volt motherboard power
   The AGP data bus may be 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bits. Due to timing
   requirements the maximum bus length is 9". The trace impedance is
   specified as 65 ohms +/- 15 ohms (no termination resistor is
   specified). For the 8x speed the bus requires a parallel termination or
   50 ohms. Some lines may require a Pull-Up Resistor to insure the lines
   come out of reset in the proper state. The AGP Interface is optimized
   for FR4 PCB designs. Both 4 layer and 6 layer PCBs have been studied.
   AGP 2.0 pin out, 2 rows of 66 finger [pins]. The Pin Outs for AGP 3.0
   specification differ from the AGP 2.0 Standard.
   Not all AGP cards will work in all AGP slots. Use the table below, to
   determine if an AGP board will function in a particular motherboard.
   The AGP pinout list is provided lower down the page.
   AGP Card / Motherboard Functionality
   AGP 2.0 Cards AGP 3.0 Cards
   MotherBoard 3.3 Connector 1.5 Conn. Universal Conn. Univ. AGP3.0 Conn
   AGP3.3 Conn
   AGP 3.3 Works Keyed Wrong Works Keyed Wrong Keyed Wrong
   AGP 1.5 Keyed Wrong Works Works Works No Function
   AGP Universal Works Works Works Works No Function
   Univ. AGP 3.0 Keyed Wrong Works Works Works Works
   AGP3.0 Keyed Wrong No Function No Function Works Works
   AGP 3.0 boards only work off of a 1.5 volt connectors / Mother Boards
   There are three different key configurations for AGP cards: 3.3v keyed
   [1x, 2x], 1.5v keyed [4x, 8x], 1.5v universal keyed [1x, 2x, 4x].
   ______________________________________...
   You will have to copy and paste the text to try to read the table
   above, since the encoding on their website, and ANSWERS does
   not match and the TABS and spaces are wrong..
   BUT, as you can see from the text descriptions, " ANY " 8x AGP card
   will not fit in " ANY " 4 X slot since there are at least 3 different
   keying arrangements, and your motherboard manufacturer does not list
   the keys - if you carefully look at the keys and cross reference, the
   pin numbers you could tell.
   To make things worse, there are a dozen non- standard so-called " AGP "
   cards and motherboard combos shipped from Taiwan etc. that dont match
   anything, except each other.
   The bottom line is that you really must do your homework and be aware
   that whatever you buy to put in MAY NOT be guaranteed to work.
   The 8X " standard" is supposed to work backwards, and if all the
   motherboard manufacturers and AGP card manufacturers actually followed
   the specifications to the letter, they would.
   THEN... there is the issue of purchasing an expensive new 8X card that
   will only give you 10% improvement at best, on a motherboard that lists
   the highest CPU speed in the manual at
   1.3 GIG Hz. You may want to consider the options of getting more ram,
   getting a faster harddrive, removing background programs in Windows
   that are wasting your CPU speed ( typically Start/ Run / msconfig ).
   This way, the new harddrive at a higher rpm and more cache could be
   used on your next machine. It is unlikely that the ram would be useable
   on a new platform, so look on ebay for cheap ram - everyone is dumping
   it at very good proces ( ecxept in the retail outlets ).
   A recent ANSWER had a good response to this question which I will
   repeat here:
   ______________________________________...
   WellTraveledprog
   You wouldn't see a 2X performance increase for the 8X over the 4X for
   any game, movie,etc. That's because the only thing that's twice as fast
   is the data transfer rate from main memory to the graphics card, not
   the whole system. And even if the data can *get* to the graphics card
   twice as fast, there's no guarantee the graphics card can use it twice
   as fast :)
   In general, for graphics-heavy applications like a 3D game at high res,
   I'd expect maybe a 10% speed increase for an 8X over 4X AGP card. Some
   particular things would run much faster than 10% faster, and you might
   be able to run at a higher resolution while keeping an acceptable
   framerate...but the difference really won't be that big. You'd see a
   much better speed increase going to a PCI-Express slot than you would
   between 4x and 8x AGP.
   Hope that helps :)

   Hope that this helps ! I know it looks confusing - because it is -
   anyone who just sayes
   " NO " you cant, probably had an 8X that was keyed differently with the
   wrong voltage keys, and anyone who sayes " YES " probably had a
   UNIVERSAL 8X AGP card put in a UNIVERSAL keyed AGP 4X slot, and had no
   problems...
   If only life were that simple...
   If anyone worked in a shop where they assemble 25 computers a day, and
   upgrade another 15 a day, they would KNOW that there are exceptions to
   every rule !
   Shop around and do your homework !
   Consider the options, consider the prices... you are on the web, and it
   is a powerful tool to get information from many sources.
   Good luck

       I love it when people answer and have no idea what they are talking
       about, yes it will work but it will be slower. The rule on AGP is
       that they are always backwards compatible one step, meaning an 8
       will go in a 4 and a 4 will go in a 2, etc.

       It should fit and work at 4x speeds. The difference is the
       information bandwidth.

       yes it will work but only at 4x .... the diference is the "speed"
       at which it runs like on a cd rom 4x is slower than 8x ....... hope
       that helps

       my friend, it will not work. The slots are different. The
       difference between the two is mainly the speed.
