Football Fans Are Overly Optimistic About Their Team, Study Finds

   SUNDAY, Sept. 13, 2015 (HealthDay News) — As the National Football
   League kicks off its 2015 season this weekend, fans across the country
   are certain that this is the year for their team.

   But a new study shows that pro football fans and dedicated sports
   reporters often overestimate their team’s chances of going all the way.

   “We should perhaps take the predictions of experts assigned to a single
   team with a pinch of salt as they may not appreciate the bigger
   picture,” study senior author Brad Love, a professor of psychology and
   language sciences at University College London, said in a university
   news release.

   “Previous studies suggest that just following a team intensely can lead
   to bias, so that is also probably going on here. Fans and experts alike
   can get focused on improvements or changes for the team that they
   follow, and don’t realize that it’s an arms race with other teams who
   are also improving,” Love explained.

   Football fans aren’t just overly optimistic about their own team’s
   prospects; they’re also extra pessimistic about a rival team’s chances,
   the study showed. Researchers said their findings can shed light on a
   concept known as “optimism bias.”

   The “NFL is the perfect system to study optimism bias because it’s zero
   sum — one team winning means another team losing,” Love said.

   More than 1,100 NFL fans were asked to predict how many games their
   favorite and most hated teams would win during the 2015 season. Since
   each team plays 16 games that produce only one winner, the overall
   average number of wins for each team is always eight. Yet, the average
   number of wins for the participants’ “favorite” teams was 9.59,
   suggesting every fan was overly optimistic about their team’s chances
   of winning.

   The findings were published Sept. 9 in the journal PLOS ONE.

   The researchers also examined ESPN data on 32 sports reporters who were
   each assigned to one NFL team. When asked to predict how many games
   their team would win, the reporters, like the NFL fans, were all overly
   optimistic, the study found.

   The researchers found that the New England Patriots were the most liked
   team among the study participants. They were also the most hated in the
   NFL, the study found. Both fans and rivals of the Patriots assumed they
   would perform well in 2015, but the team’s fans expected one more win
   than the haters did.

   The discrepancy between fan and rival predictions were only about one
   game for the Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles.
   There were larger optimism gaps for the Cincinnati Bengals and Arizona
   Cardinals, the study noted.

   “It’s interesting that both fans and rivals of high-profile, successful
   teams are generally in agreement about their expected performance,”
   said Love. “By contrast, we see the largest optimism gap for
   lower-profile teams that receive little national media coverage,
   enabling fans and local media to construct their own optimistic
   narratives.”

   The study’s authors advised fans who bet on games to consider their
   optimism bias before putting money on their favorite team since their
   expectations may not be realistic.

   unrealistic expectations, or [98]optimistic bias.
