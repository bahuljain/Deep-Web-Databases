Most Doctors Couldn't Spot A Human-Trafficking Victim If They Saw One. Could
You?

   [79]Jenna BirchMarch 18, 2015
   Most Doctors Couldnʼt Spot A Human-Trafficking Victim If They Saw One.
   Could You?

   Less than 10 percent of doctors recognize trafficking victims, and less
   than 3 percent of ER doctors have received training in recognition and
   action. Here’s what we can do about it. (Photo: Getty Images)

   When his church embarked on a small project to help prevent human
   trafficking, Douglas Chin, MD, a surgeon in Oakland, Calif., joined the
   group.

   In their minds human trafficking was an overseas problem. Church
   members began looking into ways to address gender inequity outside the
   country by empowering women, which experts agreed would help reduce the
   sex trade, strengthen global health, and lead to better economic
   opportunities. “We were really thinking, ‘What can we do in the United
   States to help international women — in Thailand, in India?” Chin tells
   Yahoo Health.

   But then a young woman went to Chin’s office in California for a
   routine orthopedic problem, and he noticed something very unusual. She
   came with an older male figure, who spent the appointment hovering
   close by. She was reticent. She had tattoos on her body, and gray marks
   on her skin.

   He later found out that the young woman was a victim of human
   trafficking.

   “The gray marks were something called postinflammatory
   hyperpigmentation, which is the result of repeated trauma. The tattoos
   were probably indicating she was property,” Chin says. “It just hit me.
   At church, we were looking at this as an international problem, yet it
   was right here under our noses.

   “A lot of these victims were likely seeking medical help. Were we just
   missing them?”

   Trafficking in the United States

   Human trafficking, for both sex and labor, is not just an international
   problem; it is a U.S. problem. According to estimates, roughly 1
   million adults and 400,000 children are presumed to be at risk for sex
   trafficking annually on American soil.

   It’s big business, with relatively low risk and high reward, says Holly
   Atkinson, MD, director of the Human Rights Program at Mount Sinai in
   New York City and co-chair of the American Medical Women’s
   Association’s, [80]Physicians Against the Trafficking of Humans (PATH)
   initiative. Global revenues for human trafficking likely [81]exceed $31
   billion, according to estimates.
   image

   “It is so lucrative, probably only second to drug trafficking in
   revenue,” Atkinson tells Yahoo Health. “This is because you can sell a
   human 10, 20, even 30 times a day. You can’t sell drugs or a firearm
   that many times.”

   And there is no specific profile for victims of trafficking. It can
   affect people of any gender, age, race or social class. Chin says that
   while more than 80 percent of labor-trafficking victims in the United
   States are brought in from foreign countries, that stat is flipped for
   sex-trafficking victims. “Roughly 80 percent of those victims are
   American-born, U.S. citizens,” says Chin. “It affects all demographics,
   from the affluent to the underprivileged.”
   image

   And traffickers seek victims everywhere. “One of the biggest myths is
   that it doesn’t happen here or that most victims are foreign-born —
   with sex trafficking, it’s not true,” says Atkinson. “They’re
   recruiting at schools, in shopping malls. They are using psychological
   techniques, acting as boyfriends to young girls, buying them things —
   and then they start to ask for things. ‘If you really loved me, you’d
   have sex with my friend.’”

   Certain risk factors do make a person more vulnerable to that slippery
   slope into trafficking, though, including being from a broken home. “It
   is higher in specific demographics,” Atkinson says. “Among runaways,
   [and among] LGBT, sexually-abused and foster children.”

   What’s difficult about trafficking is that it’s a hidden problem. You
   can pass victims everyday on the street and not really realize it —
   especially because many of the young women and men who are initially
   victimized and pushed into this life of captivity become attached to
   their captors and can’t find a way out, according to [84]Elaine
   Richardson, Ph.D, a professor at the Department of Teaching and
   Learning at The Ohio State University and a former victim of sex
   trafficking.
   image

   “Young victims are in middle schools, in your neighborhood, or even in
   your family,” she tells Yahoo Health. “Some of them are grown women,
   and many are not doing it just because they enjoy sex and want to get
   paid for it. Many victims have become entrapped into a way of life,
   even if they now seem to be doing it for themselves without pimps.”

   Once you’re in the middle of this life, it’s hard to climb out, says
   Richardson. “They are still human beings who deserve to be valued as
   humans, who need help, support, and love,” she says.
   image

   And they might be able to find support in the places where most men,
   women, and even trafficking victims eventually go: clinics, doctor’s
   offices and hospitals. Even dentists can be essential in victim
   identification, says Atkinson. While ER physicians might see a victim
   for an acute medical problem like a broken bone or STD, dentists may
   see a victim for a chronic issue that finally needs to be addressed, or
   for cosmetic surgery to try and improve a young woman’s attractiveness
   and overall value.

   According to research published in the Annals of Health Law, some
   estimates suggest that 87 percent of trafficking victims have had
   contact with a healthcare provider while being trafficked.

   A Public Health Issue

   “We often think of trafficking as a social or justice problem,” says
   Chin. “But it’s also a public health problem.” On March 14, 2015,
   doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School,
   and San Francisco General Hospital held a training session for
   physicians and healthcare professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area,
   in order to get them thinking about trafficking in a new light — and
   see the role they could play in combating it.

   Why Are We Following Old Protocols?

   The event was organized by the American Medical Women’s Association,
   following a [86]2013 report by the National Academies’ Institute of
   Medicine that urged better antitrafficking education for those working
   in the healthcare field.
   image

   “Research tells us that fewer than 10 percent of doctors actually
   recognize trafficking victims, and fewer than 3 percent of ER doctors
   had received training in recognition and action,” Chin says. “There is
   a huge disparity in the number of victims seeking help and the number
   of doctors who could recognize them.”

   Chin, the director of outreach for PATH, says the training was broken
   down into three distinct parts: the scope of the public health problem,
   how to identify a victim, and how to help or act.
   image

   Physicians were taught how to recognize signs that a person seeking
   medical care is a victim. These include any of the risk factors related
   to background and personal history, in addition to physical evidence
   such as bruises, tattoos, brands and burns. “Sometimes, we’ll literally
   find burns as a way of branding or discipline,” says Chin, who says
   victims are often marked for ownership, sometimes on the face or with
   ink like barcodes, dollar signs and names of male captors or pimps.
   “You can also see signs of beating, scars, and orthopedic trauma,” he
   says.

   Psychological signs are also common, including extreme anxiety, PTSD
   symptoms, anger and belligerent comments. “These victims are very
   mistrustful, which often puts doctors off while treating them, but it’s
   really a defense mechanism,” says Chin.

   In terms of addressing the problem after doctors identify a victim,
   Chins says the path to success is less clear-cut. “There are not a lot
   of statistics or research on how to best help someone, because this is
   such an underground problem,” he says.

   Doctors are often face a dilemma once they suspect a patient is a
   victim, especially because laws in many states do not favor victims of
   sex trafficking. “They’ll often be arrested for prostitution if it’s
   reported,” Chin says. “although the laws are slowly catching up.”The
   New York Assembly, for instance, [88]just passed a bill establishing
   stricter penalties for sex-trafficking perpetrators that gives more
   liberties to law enforcement officials to investigate.

   By law, most doctors dealing with children have an obligation to report
   trafficking suspicions. However, each state has different guidelines,
   and it’s a tough call for docs when filing a report might put a victim
   in the way of more trouble. “The limitation is whether or not to report
   in some cases,” Chin says. “You have to balance the obligation against
   the doctor-patient privacy.”
   image

   However, the foundation of helping a victim is trust. “The worst thing
   we can do is give them a pill to pop for their problem and say they
   don’t need to follow up,” Chin explains. “We need to find ways to bring
   them back to the clinic.”

   Doctors use an approach called a trauma-informed model when dealing
   with people who should signs of anxiety related to trauma. “Ultimately,
   we need to treat them as traumatized individuals with compassion,
   listening to them,” says Chin. “We shouldn’t be asking them ‘What’s
   wrong with you?’We need to ask, ‘What has happened to you?’”

   What We Can Do

   Chin says the March event received high praise, as doctors really do
   want to help in the efforts against trafficking. “We’ve had so much
   positive feedback,” he says. “We’ve been asked to conduct training
   events in other cities. We think this should be mandatory training for
   physicians and healthcare professionals.”

   Atkinson is hopeful that more education will be required. She’s already
   conducted sessions on the topic at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of
   Medicine, where she is a professor. “We need education for doctors,
   nurses, physician assistants,” she says. “Since victims are often seen
   in the emergency departments, in urgent cares, in ob-gyns, in dentists’
   offices — the medical profession has an important role to play. They
   are the front lines.”

   In addition, anyone can help if he or she suspects someone is a victim
   of trafficking. Atkinson says that people can call the [89]National
   Human Trafficking Resource Center’s anonymous hotline at 1-888-373-7888
   with a tip.
   image

   Human-trafficking victims are rescued one at a time. “It’s not about
   saving everyone — it’s a complicated issue,” Atkinson says. “Once we
   get all professionals trained, it just means they have the opportunity
   to intervene and offer meaningful help.”

   The problem is so much bigger than any one person, though; it permeates
   modern culture, says Atkinson. “It’s a very deep issue,” she explains.
   “It is about poverty, it’s about sexual exploitation, it’s about the
   pimping of American culture — there are so many factors.”

   And while there is no quick fix, a greater awareness of the silent
   victims around us will help — for medical professionals, for the
   general public, for victims being forced into trafficking and for
   victims who can’t find their way out.

   What can you do? As someone who has been there, Richardson provides
   insight. “If they are visibly being coerced, of course, continue to
   call the authorities to try to help them escape,” she says. “If they
   are now addicted to the life and are trafficking themselves, try to be
   a light in their life, try to speak life to them, talk them into going
   into treatment, speak love into them.”
