WHO Admits Botched Response to Ebola in Africa

   October 17, 2014
     __________________________________________________________________

   [ebola85.jpg]

   FRIDAY, Oct. 17, 2014 (HealthDay News) — The World Health Organization
   has admitted it dropped the ball with the Ebola epidemic in West
   Africa, according to a news report published Friday.

   In a draft internal memo obtained by the Associated Press, WHO blamed
   incompetent staff and other factors for not curbing at the outset what
   is now the largest Ebola outbreak in history.

   “Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some
   fairly plain writing on the wall,” WHO officials said in the document,
   according to the AP. In a region with substandard health systems and
   unsealed borders, it should have been apparent that the usual
   infection-control methods wouldn’t work, the U.N. health agency memo
   said.

   As of Wednesday, 4,493 people had died out of 8,997 reported cases of
   Ebola infection, according to WHO. Nearly all cases and deaths have
   occurred in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. WHO officials now say
   that there could be 10,000 new cases of Ebola every week within two
   months if the battle against the deadly virus is not stepped up.

   Blasting its own bureaucrats, the WHO memo said the heads of the
   agency’s national offices in Africa are “politically motivated
   appointments” made by the WHO regional director for Africa. As a
   “particularly alarming” example, it said the head of its Guinea office
   wouldn’t help get visas for Ebola experts trying to enter the country.
   So far, Guinea has had more than 840 deaths attributed to the virus.

   One of the scientists who discovered the Ebola virus echoed the
   criticism. “It’s the regional office in Africa that’s the front line,”
   Dr. Peter Piot told the AP on Friday. “And they didn’t do anything.
   That office is really not competent.

   “I called for a state of emergency to be declared in July and for
   military operations to be deployed,” Piot told the news service. The
   agency finally declared Ebola an international health emergency in
   August.

   That was five months and 1,000 deaths after the first cases were
   reported, Piot noted.
