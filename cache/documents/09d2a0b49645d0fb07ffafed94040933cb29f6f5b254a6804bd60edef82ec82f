       thou perfect examples of humanaity and the walking embodiment of
       Christ on earth take their lil ones by the hand every year and
       allow them to receive goods/candy from strangers dressed as
       demons,devils,witches,goblins,ghost and vampires!!...they even
       dress their kids as the afore mentioned (all the while they claim
       they are serving GOD and GOD only!!)...they decorate their homes to
       look like cemerteries and hunted houses! and yet they expect the
       rest of us to believe that they are not HYPOCRITES!! YOUR BIBLE
       SAYS "YOU CAN'T SERVE TWO GODS EITHER YOU WILL LOVE ONE AND HATE
       THE OTHER"...IT ALSO SAYS THAT "YOU CAN'DT STRADDLE THE
       FENCE"....AND IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT "EITHER YOU ARE HOT OR
       COLD"!!!... these people love to play church but if they were
       serious there would be no way that they would even contemplate
       dressing up and going out on holloween (you cant have it both ways)
       would you dress your kids as a KKK member or associate with them if
       they were not one?.....yet you celerbrate the polar opposite of
       your belief (and then has the audacity to speak for GOD and say he
       understands!!!!WOW)

       fingers in my throat. I tried it with a toothbrush too, and I tried
       drinking salt water. I just ate a lot of food and I think I would

       I live with my mom so that I can help her take care of my dad (
       he's real sick) and yesterday when I got home from work my back was
       killing me and my mom offered to 'crack' it for me. I've never had
       anyone 'crack' my back before, but I figured my mom must know what
       she's doing since she used to do it for my dad. so she made me lay
       on the floor on my stomach and then take deep breaths and every
       time I breathed out she'd step on my back and do a little bouncy
       thing. My back did pop and it felt good at first, but she did my
       whole back, and when she got to my low back it shifted and popped
       in a vey uncomfortable way. I told her it hurt, but she said it was
       fine and then told me to go make sure my dad took his pills. I got
       up this morning and my lower back was killing me. I told my mom and
       she told me to lay down on the floor the way I did before, then she
       did the same thing and my back popped but it hurt worse. I went to
       work because I can't afford to miss a day, but my boss sent me home
       because I couldn't function with all the pain. Mom said it should
       pass, but just getting off the toilet is excruciating. What should
       I do?

       For about a year, once or twice a month I have woken up at night.
       When I wake up I usually go to the bathroom and get a drink. After
       I go back to bed and after a few minutes of trying to sleep my
       whole body feels tingly and my heart starts pounding and I can hear
       loud banging in my ears. I always have my eyes closed when this
       happens and I can't seem to open them, I can't really do anything.
       I also hear someone in my head yelling and see vivid pictures (like
       a dream) there's also a loud banging inside my head. I feel very
       scared. The only thing I can't think of is that this is anxiety
       related or maybe some weird form of sleep paralysis. Extra Details:
       I'm 16 and biologically female. I have a bit of anxiety during the
       day about some situations but never full panic attacks.

       talking about APPLES AND APPLES NOT APPLES AND ORANGES.).....
       Basically the Bible gives the WOMAN no AUTHORITY over the MAN THE
       HOUSE OR THE CHURCH!!!......But yet we have WOMEN running for the
       highest office in the land with the real possibility of
       winnning......how is it that GOD does not give them AUTHORITY over
       man,church or home but allows them to USURP AUTHORITY over the
       whole country?........there is no excuse for it if you call
       yourself a follower of GODS word and if you see it any other way
       you are a HYPOCRITE AND THE TRUTH IS NOT IN YOU!! (GOD say "I AM TH
       SAM TODAY,YESTERDAY AND FOREVER MORE"...I"I AM THE LORD AND I
       CHANGE NOT"...which simply mean don't change my words to fit your
       corrupt agenda! my question is....is the BIBLE or Christians fake?
       your answers is of great concern.
