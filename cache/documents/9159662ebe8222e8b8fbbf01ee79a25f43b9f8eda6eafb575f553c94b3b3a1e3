   The amazing thing about this story is that they don't mention the 17
   strikeouts...
   Routine and Bravery in His Personal Life; A Near No-hitter in His
   Professional One
   Blue Jays right handed pitcher Brandon Morrow is a diabetic. He also
   came extremely close to being the sixth man to throw a no hitter in the
   Major Leagues this year, as today he shut down one of the best teams in
   baseball, the Tampa Bay Rays. He gave up only one hit, on a ball that
   the second baseman dove for and had it hit off of his glove. It
   richocheted into right field with two outs in the top of the ninth
   inning.
   Morrow, on the field at least, has had a brief and, until today,
   unremarkable major league career. Before today, he had a 16 and 18
   lifetime record and a 4.71 earned run average. Today, however, he
   nearly secured his place in baseball immortality.
   But to millions of diabetics around the world, Morrow was, or at least
   should have been, a role model already.
   In his senior year in high school, Morrow began losing weight and
   drinking inordinate amounts of water. He mentioned his situation to a
   friend who said the symptoms sounded similar to that of diabetes.
   Morrow saw a doctor and a short while later, he was diagnosed with Type
   1 diabetes.
   Morrow, however, did not allow the chronic disease slow him down. In
   fact, he sees the steps he needs to take to manage his diabetes as
   being very similar to the things all successful Major League Baseball
   players must do; he realized that routine would be a very important
   part of his life going forward.
   In an interview earlier this year, Morrow said about battling diabetes,
   "Right off the bat it's all about routine. You've got to keep your
   sugar levels stable and in a good range. So develop your routine,
   especially on game days. It doesn't have to be a worry. Find what works
   for you so then you don't have to worry about, 'Man, am I going to go
   low during a game?' Once you have that routine down, you're fine."
   While ultimately talent matters the most when competing at the top
   level of any sport, the discipline and focus required for Morrow to
   compete in the Major Leagues likely seems like small potatoes when
   compared to the importance his health routine commands; the ability to
   stay focused on testing, adjusting and measuring his blood sugar levels
   regardless of what else is going on that day.
   On some level, the routine inherent to playing Major League Baseball
   may make it easier for Morrow to stay focused on his diabetic needs and
   routine. But similarly, the focus and discipline that Morrow has
   demonstrated
   throughout his adult life when staying focused on his health needs must
   make his baseball routine seem easy by comparison.
   Today, Brandon Morrow, a type 1 diabetic, conquered the Tampa Bay Rays
   in near no-hit fashion; it must somehow seems rather trivial in
   comparison to his battle against diabetes while also meaning everything
   in the world to diabetics around both Canada and the United States.

   How ironic that the term "small potatoes" should be used in this
   article LOL.
   Thanks for the article Morris.

   Diabetes makes Morrow gem more notable
   By Steve Henson, Yahoo! Sports
   14 hours, 31 minutes ago
   A pitcher taking a no-hitter into the late innings nearly goes nuts
   when his team is batting because baseball superstition dictates that
   nobody in the dugout talks to him. The pitcher sits and sits, anxiously
   waiting for three outs so he can get back to the mound.
   Brandon Morrow�s(notes) experience was different. The Toronto Blue Jays
   right-hander had no problem filling his down time Sunday while setting
   down the Tampa Bay Rays inning after inning. He checked his blood
   sugar. He sipped just the right amount of a sports drink. He knew that
   if he felt too low or too high, not only would any chance of a
   no-hitter be dashed, his body could shake uncontrollably, his vision
   could blur and he might not know where he was, let alone what he was
   doing.

   Litsch following Morrow's one-hitter.
   (AP Photo/The Canadian Press,Darren Calabrese)
   Morrow has Type 1 diabetes. The only time he takes off his insulin pump
   is when he pitches, so between innings his first thought isn�t about
   his arm, it�s about his blood-sugar level. And moments after losing the
   no-hitter with two out in the ninth but finishing off a masterful
   17-strikeout, 1-0 victory for his first career complete game, Morrow
   fought through the swirl of emotions and went about the dispassionate
   self-diagnosis that has become his routine.
   �I check my blood sugar more on a start day because I have a tendency
   to get low during warmups,� he said last month. �Sometimes I try to be
   too perfect in keeping my blood sugar levels right and I give myself a
   touch too much insulin and I fall a little low and I�ll need a Gatorade
   before the game starts. Then I have to check again after the first
   inning and after the second, and usually from there I�m all right.�
   The spate of no-hitters (there have been six) and near no-hitters
   (three have been spoiled in the ninth) this season has reinforced the
   notion that every player has an interesting backstory waiting to be
   told.
   We learned that Dallas Braden(notes) of the Oakland Athletics was
   raised in a Stockton, Calif., motel by his grandmother � but not until
   he pitched a perfect game on Mothers Day. We learned that Ubaldo
   Jimenez(notes) of the Colorado Rockies likely would be a doctor in the
   Dominican Republic were it not for his cannon of a right arm � but not
   until he pitched a no-hitter in April. We gained insight into the
   machine-like Roy Halladay(notes), the mercurial Matt Garza(notes) and
   the nomadic Edwin Jackson(notes) on the days they pitched no-hitters.
   And we perhaps learned the most about Armando Galarraga(notes), the
   Detroit Tigers right-hander who displayed exceptional grace and
   sportsmanship after losing a perfect game June 2 on an umpire�s blown
   call with two out in the ninth.
   About Morrow we learned not only that he has a disease that afflicts
   more than 23 million Americans, but that he has the discipline and
   self-awareness to keep it in check while performing at the highest
   level. He also displayed the fortitude to win the game after his no-hit
   hopes were dashed.
   Brandon Morrow acknowledges the crowd following his one-hit complete
   game against the Tampa Bay Rays.
   (AP Photo/The Canadian Press,Darren Calabrese)
   Morrow�s fastball was live and his slider devastating throughout. The
   only ball close to a hit until the ninth was a drive by Ben
   Zobrist(notes) in the sixth that Vernon Wells(notes) caught before
   slamming into the outfield wall. The 17 strikeouts were one short of
   the Blue Jays� record set by Roger Clemens in 1998.
   With two out in the ninth, Evan Longoria(notes) took an outside
   fastball on a 1-1 count and slapped a ground ball between first and
   second. Second baseman Aaron Hill(notes) nearly made the play on a dive
   to his left, but the ball squirted from his glove when his arm hit the
   ground. After a visit to the mound from manager Cito Gaston, Morrow
   struck out Dan Johnson(notes) to end the game.
   �That�s my first complete game and first shutout,� Morrow said. �Those
   things combined are more than enough to overcome the feeling of just
   missing a no-hitter. That would have been a great feat but I�ll start
   with a complete game, one-hit shutout with 17 strikeouts.�
   Not a word about his diabetes. As long as he�s attentive to it, Morrow
   believes it is immaterial. However, his condition played a role in his
   former team, the Seattle Mariners, moving him to the bullpen after he
   was drafted No. 5 overall in 2006, ahead of Tim Lincecum(notes) and
   Clayton Kershaw(notes) and two picks behind Longoria. The Mariners knew
   Morrow had been diagnosed as a diabetic in high school and were
   concerned about his stamina.
   �In the bullpen I had a routine where I�d check my blood sugar in the
   fifth inning and make sure everything was all right,� he said. �I�d
   usually have a protein bar or something to give me some energy and then
   I�d take my pump off, stretch and get ready for the game.�
   He made 100 relief appearances in 2007 and 2008, then made 10 starts
   and 15 relief appearances in 2009 before being traded after the season
   to the Blue Jays for reliever Brandon League(notes) and minor league
   pitcher Johermyn Chavez. Toronto immediately thrust him into the
   rotation and after a slow start Morrow, 25, has been solid since late
   May, going 5-1 in his last 12 starts and watching his ERA drop from
   6.66 to 4.45.
   The near no-hitter offered a glimpse into his potential. And the
   performance also raised awareness about his battle with diabetes.
   �It�s all about routine,� Morrow said. �You got to keep your sugar
   levels stable and in a good range. So, develop your routine, especially
   on game days. It doesn�t have to be a worry.�
   The way this season is going, a pitcher flirting with or finishing off
   a no-hitter is likely to happen again, at which time another
   fascinating backstory will gain a wider audience.
   Morrow today, who tomorrow?

   Remember to note that the Chicago Bear's quarterback, Jay Cutler, is
   also diabetic when they win the Super Bowl this year. Smile
