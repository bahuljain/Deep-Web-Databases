Study Might Explain Brain Overgrowth Seen in Autism

   March 23, 2012
     __________________________________________________________________

   [genetics_MIC028ML.jpg]
   By Jenifer Goodwin
   HealthDay Reporter

   FRIDAY, March 23 (HealthDay News) — Researchers report that they have
   identified abnormalities in the DNA and RNA of cells in the prefrontal
   cortex of the brains of autistic children.

   The findings may help to explain the underlying mechanism for the brain
   “overgrowth” that prior reports have documented in autistic children.
   Those studies have found that the brains of young children with autism
   are larger than the brains of non-autistic children, particularly in
   the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is key to complex thoughts
   and behaviors, including language, social behavior and decision-making.

   This growth abnormality likely contributes significantly to the social,
   communication, and emotional deficits common among people with autism,
   the researchers said.

   In the new study, researchers analyzed tissue from the prefrontal
   cortexes of 33 postmortem brain samples from autistic and non-autistic
   people aged 2 to 56.

   In addition to DNA differences known as copy number variations,
   researchers also did genome-wide RNA profiling and found differences in
   RNA between the autistic and non-autistic brains. RNA (ribonucleic
   acid) plays crucial roles within cells, serving as an intermediary
   between DNA, the blueprints for genetic information, and the production
   of proteins that carry out a vast array of vital activities in cells.

   The RNA abnormalities appear to be involved with genes that code for
   proteins regulating cellular growth, the researchers said.

   “What we found was the networks that are supposed to regulate the
   genesis of brain cells and develop them were abnormal. The networks
   that were supposed to regulate DNA repair were turned down. And the
   networks supposed to regulate neuron removal and survival were
   abnormal,” said study author Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism
   Center of Excellence at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)
   School of Medicine.

   The study is published in the March 22 issue of PLoS Genetics.

   How might these differences fit into the autistic picture?

   Preliminary research by the UCSD team found that an excessive amount of
   neurons, or brain cells, might account for the overgrowth. While
   typically developing kids had about 0.88 billion neurons in the
   prefrontal cortex, autistic children had about 1.57 billion.

   According to the researchers, the copy number variations along with the
   RNA abnormalities may disrupt the cell cycle and may explain the
   underlying mechanism driving the overgrowth.

   “We found DNA defects, or copy number variations, in a variety of genes
   that regulate cell production and cell survival,” Courchesne said. “To
   us, that suggests the explanation for why there are an abnormal number
   of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Those genes fall into networks
   that control the number of neurons generated and the number that
   survive in prenatal life.”

   Researchers also noted that the RNA differences vary, depending on the
   age of the brain, with children and adults having different RNA
   profiles.

   Courchesne said that the way the brain responds to that overgrowth of
   neurons — in other words, what’s happening in those repair pathways —
   may help to explain why people with autism may have different
   trajectories, with some seeming to regress and others continuing to
   learn new skills throughout their lifetime.

   “In adulthood, we see individuals that continue to improve, and
   continue to gain more and more skills and abilities,” Courchesne said.
   “Then there are others that don’t show that continued, ongoing
   improvement or show the opposite. My best guess is the trajectory has
   less to do with the original cause of the autism, than with an
   individual’s specific composition of genes, or the available genes to
   remodel the brain.”

   Robert Ring, vice president for translational research at Autism
   Speaks, said researchers offer up a provocative and plausible theory.
   However, he noted that while brain overgrowth is well-established, only
   one, small study has shown that the explanation for it is too many
   neurons.

   “What’s valuable about the approach this group has taken is that
   they’ve gone directly to the tissue of interest, and have asked, ‘Is
   there any evidence there are abnormalities in the expression of genes
   that correlate with the neuro-anatomic or cellular findings that have
   been reported?'” Ring said.

   “What they’re reporting is there is indeed some evidence that
   particular pathways might be disregulated in the autistic brain vs. the
   control brain, and some of these pathways, when you look at their
   function, may be a plausible explanation for the increased growth and
   increased cell number.”

   The study, Ring added, offers up new clues for researchers to pursue,
   but nothing is proven. “There is an enormous amount of work needed to
   confirm this,” he said.
