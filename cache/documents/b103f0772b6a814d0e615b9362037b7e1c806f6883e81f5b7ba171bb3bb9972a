Meet The ‚ÄòMIND‚Äô Diet (It Slashes Alzheimer's Risk By 35%)

   Meet The ‚ÄòMIND‚Äô Diet (It Slashes Alzheimer ºs Risk By 35%)

   There‚Äôs a rising interest in how nutrition fuels cognition and memory
   function long-term ‚Äî and now, researchers are on to a winning dietary
   formula. The bonus? Noshing your way to brain benefits doesn‚Äôt involve
   following a strict regimen.

   According to a new study published in Alzheimer‚Äôs & Dementia: The
   Journal of the Alzheimer‚Äôs Association, the so-called ‚ÄúMIND diet‚Äù could
   slash Alzheimer‚Äôs risk by 35 percent, even if a person only moderately
   adheres to the eating plan.

   Developed by nutritional epidemiologists at Chicago‚Äôs Rush University
   Medical Center, the regimen‚Äôs full name is the Mediterranean-DASH
   Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet.

   The MIND diet consists of:
     * At least three servings of whole grains a day
     * A salad and one other vegetable a day
     * A glass of wine a day
     * A serving of nuts a day
     * Beans every other day
     * Poultry and berries at least twice a week
     * Fish at least once a week
     * Limit unhealthy-brain foods, especially butter (less than one
       tablespoon a day), cheese, and fast or fried food

   To study its effects, the scientists took data on the food intake of
   923 Chicago-dwellers between ages 58 and 98 over the course of a
   decade.

   They used questionnaires to determine just how closely participants‚Äô
   eating habits mimicked one of three diet plans: the Mediterranean diet,
   the DASH diet, or the MIND diet. The researchers also measured the
   incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs over a 4.5-year follow-up period, as part of
   an ongoing research project at Rush to examine facets of cognitive
   health.

   All of the diets seemed to be effective in reducing Alzheimer‚Äôs risk.
   Those who followed DASH saw a 39 percent drop in risk, those who
   followed the Mediterranean diet saw a 54 percent drop, and those who
   adhered to the MIND plan saw a 53 percent decrease in cognitive
   decline.

   The biggest finding, though? Those who only moderately stuck to the
   Mediterranean and DASH diets did not see their Alzheimer‚Äôs risk
   decrease. Those who moderately followed MIND, on the other hand, still
   saw risk drop by 35 percent.

   Young As 20

   ‚ÄúI think that will motivate people [to try it],‚Äù says Rush nutritional
   epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, in a statement.

   As the name suggests, the MIND diet is a hybrid between the
   Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are both backed by the National
   Institute of Health as plans that offer real, research-based benefits
   to those utilizing them ‚Äî everything from reducing risk of heart
   disease and stroke to lowering blood pressure.

   There are 15 dietary components to the MIND diet, including 10 that are
   considered ‚Äúhealthy brain‚Äù food groups, and five that are considered
   ‚Äúunhealthy-brain‚Äù food groups. The point is to eat more from the
   healthy groups, and less from the unhealthy groups ‚Äî with stricter
   adherence to this rule leading to greater benefit. The healthy groups
   are green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans,
   whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. The unhealthy groups
   are red meats, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and
   fast food or fried food.

   Notably, whereas the Mediterranean and DASH diets both emphasize fruit
   consumption in general, MIND encourages berry intake in particular,
   especially cognitive-boosting blueberries and strawberries.

   In the study, the longer men and women followed the MIND diet, the
   greater their protection against cognitive decline. ‚ÄúAs is the case
   with many health-related habits, including physical exercise, you‚Äôll be
   healthier if you‚Äôve been doing the right thing for a long time,‚Äù says
   Morris.

   Past studies have also shown the DASH and Mediterranean diet plans to
   be tied to a lower risk of dementia, which, as the current study
   indicates, seems to be true. The results of the MIND diet study also
   offer strong preliminary evidence that a combination of facets of the
   two regimens hold cognitive benefits ‚Äî and luckily, it‚Äôs also easier to
   follow than the Mediterranean or DASH plans.

   Five million people in the United States currently suffer from
   Alzheimer‚Äôs, and [83]that number is expected to jump to 16 million by
   2050 ‚Äî which is even more reason to adopt these dietary practices now.

   Although more studies are needed to confirm the brain-boosting benefits
   of the MIND diet, science has already shown us the health benefits of
   the brain-boosting foods, even [84]beyond cognition. ‚ÄúIt is hard to
   come up with a potential downside to adopting these dietary habits,‚Äù
   Morris says.
