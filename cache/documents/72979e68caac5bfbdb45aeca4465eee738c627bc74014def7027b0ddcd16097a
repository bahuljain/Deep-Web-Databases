4 Fat-Burning Pre-Workout Snacks

   If you’re like me, you want to get the most out of your workout. (I’m a
   new mom and I have minimal time when I get to finally exercise.) What
   you eat before a workout can help you burn more fat and power you
   through a sweat session. Ideally, it’s best to eat about one to two
   hours before you hit the gym, go for a run, or take a fitness class to
   give your body time to digest. If you’re short on time, a smaller snack
   30 minutes beforehand is better than running on empty.

   A pre-workout meal or snack should consist of low-glycemic
   carbohydrates, lean protein, and a little bit of heart-healthy fat.
   Carbs are your body’s first form of energy and low [99]glycemic index
   (GI) foods supply a steady stream of energy as opposed to that crash
   and burn you get from high-glycemic carbs such as sugar, cereal, and
   white bread. By eating low GI carbs—such as oatmeal, whole grain bread,
   brown rice, and sweet potatoes—you’ll have more energy so you can work
   out longer and harder, which can help you burn more fat. Protein helps
   build muscle and slows down the rate of digestion, which makes it a
   smart idea to add some protein to your meal or snack. And heart healthy
   fats such as avocado, nut butters, and low-fat dairy add some flavor to
   your meal without weighing you down.

   In addition to fueling your body before a sweat session, it’s also
   crucial to [100]drink plenty of water. Being dehydrated will hinder
   your performance and can slow down your fat burning rate. I love having
   a large glass of ice cold water plus green tea or coffee with my
   pre-workout snack. Green tea and coffee have both been shown to raise
   the body’s [101]metabolic rate. They contain caffeine and antioxidants,
   which cause thermogenesis, a fancy word for the production of body
   heat. And thermogenesis encourages the body to use fat as fuel.

   Here are four creative pre-workout snacks that help keep your
   metabolism humming and your body burning more fat throughout your sweat
   session. If you’re short on time, the shake is perfect to make 30
   minutes before your workout.

   Chocolate Oatmeal
   Cook a half cup of steel cut or regular oatmeal (not instant) with 1
   cup of low-fat milk. Add 1 tablespoon chocolate protein powder and top
   with half of a sliced banana and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Serve with a
   cup of coffee or black tea.

   Nuttzo Wrap
   Warm a brown rice wrap or whole-grain sprouted tortilla in the
   microwave for 10 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon chocolate or regular
   flavored Nuttzo (or any nut butter) and four thinly sliced
   strawberries. Roll up, slice in half, and enjoy with a cup of green
   tea.

   Cinnamon Cheese “Danish”
   Toast one piece of whole-grain or sprouted [102]Ezekiel bread until
   it’s a slightly browned. Combine a 1/2 cup of low-fat cottage cheese
   with 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon stevia (or your sweetener of
   choice). Spread the cottage cheese mixture on the toast and broil in
   the oven for one to two minutes until cheese is bubbly and melted.
   Serve with a half cup of raspberries or blueberries, plus a chai latte
   or cappuccino made with fat-free milk or unsweetened vanilla almond
   milk.

   Green Tea Shake
   Blend 4 ounces of vanilla-flavored almond or rice milk, 4 ounces of ice
   cold water, one scoop of vanilla whey protein, a teaspoon of
   [103]matcha green tea powder, and ice.
