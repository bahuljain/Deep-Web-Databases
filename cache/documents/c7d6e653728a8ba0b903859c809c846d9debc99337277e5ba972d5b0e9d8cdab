Low-Dose Aspirin, Other Painkillers May Lower Colon Cancer Risk

   August 24, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18146small.jpg]

   By Alan Mozes
   HealthDay Reporter

   MONDAY, Aug. 24, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Regularly taking low-dose
   aspirin or other common pain relievers may lower long-term risk of
   colon cancer, new research suggests.

   Men and women who took low-dose (75 to 150 milligrams) aspirin for five
   years or more saw their risk of colon cancer drop by 27 percent. And
   taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen
   for that long was linked to a 30 percent to 45 percent drop in colon
   cancer risk, the study found.

   “The protective association is certainly amazing, and it’s a good
   example of how everyday drugs can have unexpected benefits,” said study
   co-author Dr. John Baron, a professor of medicine in the University of
   North Carolina School of Medicine, in Chapel Hill.

   “But there are also potential risks,” said Baron, who urged the
   findings be viewed with care.

   “I don’t think we should imply or recommend that these medications be
   taken for cancer prevention without working closely with a physician,”
   he said.

   The study did not assess the potential impact of high-dose aspirin, and
   no protective benefit was seen for irregular or short-term users of
   either low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs.

   And the study did not prove that the use of painkillers reduced the
   risk of colon cancer, just that there was an association between the
   two.

   In the United States, NSAIDs include over-the-counter Aleve (naproxen),
   Advil and Motrin (both ibuprofen), and prescription drugs such as
   Celebrex and high-strength Motrin.

   Baron emphasized that the drugs were taken continuously for years
   before any cancer-preventive benefits were realized. “For aspirin, you
   would have to take it fairly consistently, meaning at least every other
   day, for at least five to 10 years for the protective effect to even
   begin to appear,” he said.

   “That’s a significant amount of time for side effects to accumulate,
   all without getting any benefit,” he said.

   Potential side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin,
   and heightened risk for heart attack and stroke with long-term use, or
   high-dose use, of NSAIDs, according to the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration.

   In the United States, colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths,
   according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

   For the study, published in the Sept. 1 issue of the Annals of Internal
   Medicine, investigators sifted through several Danish cancer databases
   to gather the health histories of more than 10,000 colon cancer
   patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2011. Patients were between the
   ages of 30 and 85.

   Medical records were stacked up against aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID
   consumption patterns — this was possible because in Denmark most NSAIDs
   and low-dose aspirins are obtainable by prescription only.

   A comparison of cancer patients with more than 100,000 cancer-free
   Danes revealed that regular, long-term use of low-dose aspirin and
   NSAIDs seemed to confer long-term protection against colon cancer.

   The biggest benefit was linked to NSAIDs with the highest degree of
   so-called COX-2 selectivity. Celebrex is one such drug.

   That said, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires a “black box”
   warning — its strongest drug-related warning — on Celebrex packaging to
   alert users to the heightened risk for heart attack or stroke.

   The investigators said the finding of a low-dose aspirin benefit was
   qualified by the fact that only 2 percent to 3 percent of the study
   patients actually took low-dose aspirin continuously for many years.
   (Many doctors recommend patients take low-dose aspirin to help prevent
   heart attack).

   Still, Baron said the findings are “hopeful, because it means that
   we’re understanding cancer better and better.”

   That sentiment was seconded by Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor
   of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

   “The question now is really whether aspirin can also help prevent other
   cancers as well,” Chan said. “We need more research, but there’s
   already some evidence that that might be the case. And we now have a
   substantial and very consistent body of evidence showing that aspirin
   can prevent colon cancer.”

   For certain people, Chan said, “like those with a predisposition to
   colon cancer, the risk-benefit analysis might make a lot of sense.”
