   Update: its not assignment...
   its just i don't understand the arrays..
   if can't help... then shut up..
   i understand the problem but no idea how to do it with array...
   this is not comment section.
   it an Q&A site..
   Update 2: also im already in the class..laboratory right now...
   the problem is..
   we have separate sched of lab and lec..
   on lec class we are still on function.. not yet on arrays..
   on our lab..
   we are already on arrays..

       Good answer, gnome, but you missed the point. This person is
       posting his homework here instead of doing it himself. He is
       learning C++ so doesn't have the option to use another language.
       The answer to the question is to tell the questioner to pay more
       attention in class. This is a trivial problem in any language, but
       not if you don't go to class.

       I would use Perl or Ruby.
       Perl can hammer that out fast:
       [127]http://blog.codebeach.com/2008/03/array-...
       This tutorial walks through using array variables in Perl.
       Simple Arrays
       You‚Äôve already seen simple arrays. We used them for the ‚Äúcommand
       line‚Äù variables. Simple arrays begin with the ‚Äú@‚Äù symbol. If you
       want a specific value from the array, you index that value using
       its number in the array. If you want the first item from the array,
       you ask for ‚Äú$ARGV[0]‚Äù. If you want the third item, use ‚Äú$ARGV[2]‚Äù.
       Arrays always use the ‚Äú@‚Äù symbol. Scalar variables always use the
       ‚Äú$‚Äù symbol. A piece of an array is always a scalar. (You can‚Äôt have
       arrays inside of arrays in simple Perl.) That's why you use ‚Äú@‚Äù to
       refer to the entire array, and ‚Äú$‚Äù to refer to items within the
       array. If you want to know how many values are in an array, use the
       scalar variable $#ARRAY. This is actually the index of the last
       element, so for the count, you‚Äôll need to add one. For example:
       @Names = ("John","Jerry","Steve","Hsiao-Ping","Da...
       $NameCount = $#Names+1;
       print "There are $NameCount names in the array.\n";
       foreach $Counter (0..$#Names) {
       $HumanCounter = $Counter+1;
       print "Name number $HumanCounter is $Names[$Counter].\n";
       }
       @Names = sort(@Names);
       foreach $Name (@Names) {
       print $Name;
       if ($Name eq $Names[$#Names]) {
       print ".\n";
       } else {
       print ", ";
       }
       }
       The above program should produce the following:
       /u5/jerry> arraytest
       There are 5 names in the array.
       Name number 1 is John.
       Name number 2 is Jerry.
       Name number 3 is Steve.
       Name number 4 is Hsiao-Ping.
       Name number 5 is Daniel.
       Daniel, Hsiao-Ping, Jerry, John, Steve.
       Can you spot a possible problem in the above program? You‚Äôd better,
       because fixing it is going to be an exercise!
       Shifting Array Values
       You will often shift array values when you are pulling command line
       options from a command line that can also include filenames. In
       general on Unix, when a command takes both options and filenames as
       arguments, the filenames come last. The ‚Äòshift‚Äô function allows you
       to slide the first element of the array out from under the rest of
       the elements. It completely removes that element from the array.
       while ($ARGV[0] =~ /^-/) {
       $currentArg = shift(@ARGV);
       #figure out which option this is
       #blah blah
       }
       #go ahead and do the rest on the filenames
       while (<>) {
       print;
       }
       Getting a Numeric Array
       Suppose you want an array of numbers from 5 to 1000. You could
       construct it by hand, but Perl will make it for you. We‚Äòve already
       done it once with ‚Äúforeach‚Äù:
       @Counters = (5..1000);
       This numeric construction always counts up by one. If you want to
       count down instead of up, you can reverse the array:
       @Counters = reverse(@Counters);
       or, you could combine it into one line with
       @Counters = reverse(5..1000);
       Sorting Arrays
       You can sort arrays using simple or complex methods. The simplest
       way to sort an array is to use the sort function:
       @Names = sort(@Names);
       Sort always sorts in alphabetical order. If you want to sort in
       numerical order, you need to use the more complex version:
       @Numbers = sort numerically @ARGV;
       sub numerically {
       return $a <=> $b;
       }
       In this case, we‚Äôre telling ‚Äòsort‚Äô to use the ‚Äòsubroutine‚Äô
       numerically to determine how to sort the array. A ‚Äòsubroutine‚Äô is a
       bit of code that can be reused without having to retype it. In this
       case, a sort subroutine is a special subroutine that has its
       arguments automatically put into $a or $b. The subroutine must
       return an integer. If this integer is less than zero, sort assumes
       that $a comes before $b. If this integer is greater than zero, sort
       assumes that $b comes before $a. If the integer is zero, sort
       assumes it doesn‚Äôt matter.
       The operator ‚Äò<=>‚Äò returns -1 if the item on the left is less than
       the item on the right, zero if they‚Äôre equal, and 1 if the item on
       the right is less than the item on the left. Go ahead and test it:
       print $ARGV[0] <=> $ARGV[1];
       print "\n";
       You can do whatever you want in your subroutine, as long as it
       returns predictable integer values based on $a and $b.
       The equivalent to ‚Äò<=>‚Äò for strings is ‚Äòcmp‚Äô. Go ahead and replace
       ‚Äò<=>‚Äò above with ‚Äòcmp‚Äô and try different strings on the command
       line.
       Other Array Functions
       join(@array,$string)
       returns the elements of array using string as a delimiter
       pop(@array)
       returns and removes the last element of array
       push(@array,$string)
       puts string onto the end of array. Does not return ‚Äòarray‚Äô.
       shift(@array)
       returns and removes the first element of array
       split($string1,$string2)
       returns string2 split into an array wherever string1 occurs
       Associative Arrays
       Associative arrays start tapping into the database functions of
       Perl. An associative array is a list of elements, but each element
       in the array is accessed by an index value that does not have to be
       a number.
       $LastNames{'Jerry'} = 'Stratton';
       $LastNames{'John'}='Paul';
       $LastNames{'Steve'}='Spear';
       print $LastNames{$ARGV[0]};
       print "\n";
       This array stores the values ‚ÄúStratton‚Äù, ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSpear‚Äù. In
       order to access those values, I need to know the value they‚Äôre
       associated with:
       20: lastname Jerry
       Stratton
       21: lastname Steve
       Spear
       You‚Äôll use the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù function to delete an element of an
       associative array:
       $deletedName = delete $LastNames{'Steve'};
       If you need to get a list of all the keys in an associative array,
       use the keys function:
       @FirstNames = keys(%LastNames);
       foreach $key (@FirstNames) {
       print "$key: $LastNames{$key}\n";
       }
       Like scalar variables and simple arrays, associative arrays have
       their own prefix, the ‚Äúpercent‚Äù sign. Like simple arrays, you‚Äôll
       only use the percent sign when referring to the associative array
       as a whole. When referring to individual elements, you‚Äôll continue
       to use the dollar sign.
       Let‚Äôs take a look at a simple program for viewing the passwd file
       in Unix:
       $PASSWDFILE = '/var/yp/passwd';
       open PASSWDFILE;
       while (<PASSWDFILE>) {
       @lineItems = split(':');
       $username = $lineItems[0];
       $passwords{$username} = $lineItems[1];
       $userids{$username} = $lineItems[2];
       $groupids{$username}=$lineItems[3];
       $names{$username}=$lineItems[4];
       $homes{$username}=$lineItems[5];
       $shells{$username}=$lineItems[6];
       }
       close PASSWDFILE;
       foreach $User (@ARGV) {
       $User = lc($User);
       print uc($User);
       print ":\n";
       print "\tPassword: $passwords{$User}\n";
       print "\tUser ID: $userids{$User}\n";
       print "\tGroup ID: $groupids{$User}\n";
       print "\tReal Name: $names{$User}\n";
       print "\tHome Directory: $homes{$User}\n";
       print "\tDefault Shell: $shells{$User}\n";
       print "\n";
       }
       This script uses usernames as the ‚Äòkey‚Äô for this associative array.
       It could just as well have used user id. The key has to be
       something that will be unique for each ‚Äòrecord‚Äô.
       Note that in the ‚Äòsplit‚Äù line, we‚Äôve left out the $_. Perl will
       often assume that that‚Äôs what you meant, and in this case it works
       just fine.We‚Äôve also explicitly opened a file here for the first
       time. We‚Äôll have more on that later, but we put the filename into a
       scalar variable, and made sure that scalar variable was in all
       capitals. This allowed us to use the simple form for opening the
       filename contained in that variable. And don‚Äôt forget that we
       closed it at the end! If you look at the ‚Äòwhile‚Äô, you‚Äôll see that
       it looks pretty much the same as when we used the <STDIN>
       filehandle.
