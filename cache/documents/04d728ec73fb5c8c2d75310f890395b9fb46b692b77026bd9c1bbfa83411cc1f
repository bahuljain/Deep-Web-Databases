   Best Answer:  her bro, I just got the same problem just like you about
   drivers for my sounds and I don't have sound for about a week cause I
   messed with my sound card drivers. I was so scared cause I thought I
   can't find the right driver but I found this driver identifier thing
   and it worked. It automatically find the correct drivers for your
   hardware and downloads it. here: http://www.driveridentifier.com/ just
   download it and run it. after you run it, it will scan your pc for
   drivers and show the drivers. If you found the correct driver just
   download it and it will ask payment just choose *i can't pay* and then
   choose why you can't pay. then it will give 1 day free download.....

       General instructions...
       Turn the machine off (if it isn't already).
       Turn the power off at the outlet, but leave it plugged in.
       Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds to discharge any
       residual current.
       Access the inside of the machine by removing the cover. Touch a
       piece of metal to ground yourself.
       Insert the card in the correct slot and close the cover.
       Connect the monitor cable to the card.
       Turn on and check in the BIOS* that the card is detected. You may
       have to disable the onboard/integral graphics.
       Load the drivers supplied or download from the manufacturer's web
       site.
       NOTE: Some cards require the drivers be installed prior to
       connecting the card!
       *On start up keep tapping either F1, F2, F10,(Be Aware that some
       manufacturers use F10 for system recovery!) Esc, or Del, to enter
       the BIOS set-up. Save settings and exit.

       A lot of factors can deter you from installing the correct video
       driver. First and foremost if your computer has a onboard video
       card you need to make sure you disable your onboard video adapter
       from within your computers BIOS. If not the IRQ's can conflict and
       windows will not know which video card you are trying to run. Also
       you need to make sure your older video card drivers are
       uninstalled. You can always find this from within your Device
       Manager. When you stated that you have downloaded many drivers it
       seems like you may have flooded your computer operating system with
       all of these different drivers trying to run at the same time which
       in essence will conflict with each other. Its kind of like trying
       to start your car when its already running. I would recommend
       uninstalling all of your previous drivers and any programs
       associated with the drivers from within Device Manager and your
       Add/Programs. Once uninstalled make sure you reboot your computer
       to finish proper uninstallation. Once the system reboots try going
       through your computers Control Panel and selecting the Add/New
       Hardware Icon and follow the on screen prompts allowing for windows
       to detect your new Hardware. Your Video Card should pick up as it
       is plug and play and then specify windows when its looking for your
       drivers to your CD-ROM drive. Once installation is complete you
       should be able to adjust your resolution accordingly. Just always
       remember to have your monitor plugged into your new video card and
       not the onboard video card that came with your computer (if any).
       Many times at the computer shop we have had customers plugging up
       the wrong video card to their monitor and running into "blank
       screens" LOL

       First off is the card compatible with your system? You don't say
       what kind of computer and operating system you're using. Most cards
       require installation of the drivers first, then add the card. Check
       the install instructions and see which goes first.
