   Best Answer:  An extremely important hormone. It "unlocks" our cell
   walls and allows glucose (our most important source of energy) to
   enter. Without insulin, we would die in a matter of several hours. Our
   cells would literally starve to death.

       Insulin is a hormone. And like many hormones, insulin is a protein.
       Insulin is secreted by groups of cells within the pancreas called
       islet cells. The pancreas is an organ that sits behind the stomach
       and has many functions in addition to insulin production. The
       pancreas also produces digestive enzymes and other hormones
       (detailed on another page). Carbohydrates (or sugars) are absorbed
       from the intestines into the bloodstream after a meal. Insulin is
       then secreted by the pancreas in response to this detected increase
       in blood sugar. Most cells of the body have insulin receptors which
       bind the insulin which is in the circulation. When a cell has
       insulin attached to its surface, the cell activates other receptors
       designed to absorb glucose (sugar) from the blood stream into the
       inside of the cell.
       Pancreatic Islet Cells secrete insulinWithout insulin, you can eat
       lots of food and actually be in a state of starvation since many of
       our cells cannot access the calories contained in the glucose very
       well without the action of insulin. This is why Type 1 diabetics
       who do not make insulin can become very ill without insulin shots.
       Insulin is a necessary hormone. Those who develop a deficiency of
       insulin must have it replaced via shots or pumps (Type 1 Diabetes).
       More commonly, people will develop insulin resistance (Type 2
       Diabetes) rather than a true deficiency of insulin. In this case,
       the levels of insulin in the blood are similar or even a little
       higher than in normal, non-diabetic individuals. However, many
       cells of Type 2 diabetics respond sluggishly to the insulin they
       make and therefore their cells cannot absorb the sugar molecules
       well. This leads to blood sugar levels which run higher than
       normal. Occasionally Type 2 diabetics will need insulin shots but
       most of the time other methods of treatment will work.
       Pancreas Secretes InsulinInsulin was the first hormone identified
       (late 1920's) which won the doctor and medical student who
       discovered it the Nobel Prize (Banting and Best). They discovered
       insulin by tying a string around the pancreatic duct of several
       dogs. When they examined the pancreases of these dogs several weeks
       later, all of the pancreas digestive cells were gone (died and were
       absorbed by the immune system) and the only thing left was
       thousands of pancreatic islets. They then isolated the protein from
       these islets and behold, they discovered insulin. Note that there
       are other hormones produced by different types of cells within
       pancreatic islets (glucagon, somatostatin, etc) but insulin is
       produced in far greater amounts under normal conditions making the
       simple approach used by Banting and Best quite successful.

       Insulin is an animal hormone, or chemical messenger, whose presence
       informs the body's cells that the animal is well fed, causing liver
       and muscle cells to take in glucose, a form of energy for the body,
       and store it in the form of glycogen. Insulin causes fat cells to
       take in blood lipids and turn them into triglycerides. In addition,
       insulin has several other anabolic effects throughout the body
       (anabolic being the process of changing a simple substance into a
       more complex substance) .

       Insulin (to keep it short, simple, and understood) is a hormone
       produced by your pancreas to regulate your blood sugar and allow
       your cells to take in sugar to function. I hope this helps(:

       To make it short and simple Insulin is a hormone secreted by the
       isles of Langerhans in the pancreas; regulates storage of glycogen
       in the liver and accelerates oxidation of sugar in cells
