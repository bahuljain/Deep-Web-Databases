   CDC acknowledges it could have done more on Ebola Associated Press
   Tuesday, October 14, 2014
   EMILY SCHMALL and NOMAAN MERCHANT
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — The nation's top disease-fighting agency
   acknowledged Tuesday that federal health experts failed to do all they
   should have done to prevent Ebola from spreading from a Liberian man
   who died last week in Texas to the nurse who treated him.
   The stark admission from the director of the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention came as the World Health Organization projected
   the pace of infections accelerating in West Africa — to as many as
   10,000 new cases a week within two months.
   Agency Director Tom Frieden outlined a series of steps designed to stop
   the spread of the disease in the U.S., including increased training for
   health care workers and changes at the Texas hospital where the virus
   was diagnosed to minimize the risk of more infections.
   A total of 76 people at the hospital might have had exposure to Thomas
   Eric Duncan, and all of them are being monitored for fever and other
   symptoms daily, Frieden said. In addition, health officials have been
   monitoring 48 others who had some contact with Duncan before he was
   admitted to the hospital.
   The Associated Press reported Monday that Pham was among about 70
   hospital staffers who were involved in Duncan's care after he was
   hospitalized, based on medical records provided by Duncan's family.
   The announcement of the government's stepped-up effort came after top
   health officials repeatedly assured the public over the last two weeks
   that they were doing everything possible to control the outbreak by
   deploying infectious-disease specialists to the hospital where Duncan
   was diagnosed with Ebola and later died.
   "I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the patient —
   the first patient — was diagnosed. That might have prevented this
   infection. But we will do that from today onward with any case anywhere
   in the U.S.," Frieden said.
   Frieden described the new response team as having some of the world's
   leading experts in how to care for Ebola and protect health care
   workers. They planned to review everything from how the isolation room
   is laid out, to what protective equipment health workers use, to waste
   management and decontamination.
   In Europe, the WHO said the death rate in the outbreak has risen to 70
   percent as it has killed nearly 4,500 people, most of them in West
   Africa. The previous mortality rate was about 50 percent.
   President Barack Obama, speaking at the end of a meeting with U.S. and
   allied military leaders, declared that the "the world is not doing
   enough" to fight Ebola.
   "Everybody's going to have to do more than they are doing right now, he
   said.
   Nina Pham became the first person to contract the disease on U.S. soil
   as she cared for Duncan. Pham released a statement Tuesday through
   Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital saying she is "doing well," and the
   hospital listed her in good condition. The hospital CEO said medical
   staff members remain hopeful about her condition.
   The 26-year-old nurse had been in Duncan's room often, from the day he
   was placed in intensive care until the day before he died last week.
   "I'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and
   prayers," she said.
   Pham's parents live in Fort Worth, where they are part of a close-knit,
   deeply religious community of Vietnamese Catholics. Members of their
   church held a special Mass for her Monday and sorority sisters at the
   Texas Christian University held a candlelight vigil for her Tuesday. At
   the hospital, she received a plasma transfusion from a doctor who beat
   the virus.
   She and other health care workers wore protective gear, including
   gowns, gloves, masks and face shields — and sometimes full-body suits —
   when caring for Duncan. Health officials have said there was a breach
   in protocol that led to the infections, but they don't know where the
   breakdown occurred.
   Among the changes announced Tuesday by Frieden was a plan to limit the
   number of health care workers who care for Ebola patients so they "can
   become more familiar and more systematic in how they put on and take
   off protective equipment, and they can become more comfortable in a
   healthy way with providing care in the isolation unit."
   Frieden said he was fully aware of the fear among health care workers
   in Texas and around the country about the risks of contracting the
   virus should it spread further. In response, he said an on-site manager
   who is an expert in infectious diseases will be in charge of every step
   of the process, along with new training for health care workers.
   "Ebola is unfamiliar. It's scary, and getting it right is really,
   really important because the stakes are so high," he said, adding that
   he wishes the CDC had done more from the beginning.
   "We did send some expertise in infection control, but I think we could
   in retrospect, with 20/20 hindsight, we could have sent a more robust
   hospital infection-control team and been more hands on with the
   hospital from day one about how exactly this should be managed,"
   Frieden said.
   The agency explained that its initial priority in Dallas was public
   health: tracking down anyone who had contact with Duncan to be sure
   there was no spread of the virus in the community, CDC spokeswoman
   Barbara Reynolds said.
