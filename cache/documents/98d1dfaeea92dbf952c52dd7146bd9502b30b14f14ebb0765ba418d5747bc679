The Disease Many Americans Don't Know They Have

   The Disease Many Americans Donʼt Know They Have

   An alarming number of Americans are suffering from diabetes, a
   potentially deadly disease, without even knowing it.  (Getty Images)

   Editor’s Note: The data in this study did not permit the researchers to
   separately analyze type 1 and type 2 diabetes, though 90 to 95 percent
   of cases are known to be type 2. Although type 1, or insulin-dependent
   diabetes, may be better diagnosed and more prevalent among young
   people, distinguishing the two diseases would not significantly alter
   the findings or recommendations, the researchers say.

   You’d think a disease that can cause blindness, leads to amputations,
   and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States would
   incite mass panic.

   Yet Americans — and even some doctors — don’t take diabetes very
   seriously. (Did you even know it’s American Diabetes
   Month?) “Sometimes, people think ‘serious’ means things that kill you
   right away,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, chair of the Emory University
   Department of Global Health. “But, the reality is, I would be more
   concerned about diabetes than Ebola.”

   This lax attitude toward the disease may explain why nearly 30 percent
   of Americans who have diabetes don’t realize it, according to a new
   study in the [80]Annals of Internal Medicine, conducted by del Rio and
   other Emory University scientists. They analyzed health data for 29,353
   people from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey,
   identifying those with diabetes based on levels of fasting glucose
   and [81]hemoglobin A1C (an indicator of blood-sugar control).

   Overall, about 12 percent of all U.S. adults had diabetes, which
   translated to 28.4 million people in 2012. Among those, nearly 8
   million hadn’t been diagnosed — a stat that’s made all the more
   alarming by the fact that most regularly went to the doctor: Two-thirds
   of undiagnosed diabetics had seen a health care provider at least twice
   in the past year, the study found.

   Going undiagnosed — or even just delaying the process — is asking for
   internal trouble. The longer diabetes goes untreated, the worse the
   outcome tends to be. “Once the disease sets in, it’s really
   progressive,” study co-author Mohammed Ali, an assistant professor of
   global health at Emory University, told Yahoo Health. “It may be slow
   in some cases, but it leads to really disabling and often fatal
   complications.” Common but scary outcomes include vascular disease,
   kidney disease, or eye disease, which can lead to blindness.

   On the flip side, if you catch and control diabetes early, “patients
   are very likely to do well, in terms of delaying the onset of all these
   horrendous complications, preserving their quality of life,” said Ali.

   Unfortunately, the nature of the disease means that patients who should
   be undergoing blood tests often slip through the cracks: Diabetes is
   typically asymptomatic until people develop serious complications, so
   doctors don’t necessarily have clear cues to prompt them to suggest
   testing early on (although weight, family history, and lifestyle should
   be a consideration). “Diabetes is the silent killer,” said del Rio.

   And because the U.S. is a nation of episodic care — that is, we seek
   medical attention for specific symptoms, rather than as a matter of
   routine — doctors aren’t necessarily thinking about performing
   preemptive blood tests on high-risk people. Instead, they’re usually
   focusing on, say, the patient’s back-pain problem, and not his or her
   overall care.

   However, doctors are only one part of the equation: Patients may not be
   proactive about seeking care, Ali said, perhaps as a result of a low
   perceived risk of diabetes, poor insurance coverage, or even just time
   constraints. In the study, young people (ages 18 to 44) were especially
   likely to go undiagnosed, probably because they seek care only if they
   feel sick. “With diabetes, you don’t feel bad per se,” said Ali.
   “There’s a whole lot going on inside you, but you don’t feel it.”

   Even after patients are diagnosed, they aren’t necessarily controlling
   their diabetes. “We may not link them to care properly or maintain them
   in care,” said del Rio. “It’s a whole ‘cascade of care’ issue.” In the
   study, only about 1 in 5 diagnosed diabetics refrained from smoking and
   had achieved the targets for hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, and LDL
   “bad” cholesterol.

   An estimated 75 percent of those with known diabetes also had high
   blood pressure. “It’s a double whammy,” del Rio said. “High blood
   pressure impacts your blood vessels, and diabetes impacts your blood
   vessels. And it’s blood vessel disease that leads to stroke and heart
   disease.” In fact, diabetics are 1.5 times more likely to be
   hospitalized for a stroke and about 1.7 times more likely to die of
   heart disease than people without the disease, according to
   the [84]American Diabetes Association.

   “Basically, the guidelines say, ‘Don’t just focus on sugar,’” said Ali.
   “Do the whole ABCD: the A1C is the sugar measurement that we use, B is
   blood pressure, C is cholesterol, and D is do not smoke.”

   So how can our health care system ensure diabetes is caught, as well as
   treated? The first step: Increasing the emphasis on primary care, so
   patients regularly see doctors who monitor their weight, cholesterol,
   blood sugar, and vital signs, while also assessing their family
   history. “Chronic diseases are not controlled by episodic care,” said
   del Rio. “You need to have somebody that monitors you regularly.”

   And patients who are diagnosed shouldn’t be shy about voicing their
   concerns about the prescribed treatments — for example, side effects of
   diabetes drugs or a lack of time to exercise. That way, doctors can
   help devise solutions that patients are more likely to comply with.

   It’s not entirely up to the patient to halt diabetes in its tracks,
   though. “We need to start focusing on [figuring out] the interventions
   we need to do in order to improve outcomes,” del Rio said. “I envision
   doing more testing, and not only in the health care settings.” He sees
   workplaces, community centers, churches, and even local fairs as
   potential diabetes testing sites, and once people are flagged for the
   disease, he believes insurance companies should consider getting
   involved.

   “We could work with insurance providers to ensure people are actually
   getting their medications and not falling out of care,” said del Rio.
   “Because, at the end of the day, if we don’t pay for care now, we’re
   going to pay for care later when they develop renal disease and other
   complications.”
