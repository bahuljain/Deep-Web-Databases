   Best Answer:  Do You Have Diabetes?
   Millions of people have diabetes mellitus, commonly called diabetes.
   You may be surprised to know that many of these people don‚Äôt even know
   they have it.
   Diabetes is a serious disease and should not be ignored. If you have
   it, correct treatment can help you live a long and healthy life.
   What Is Diabetes?
   If you have diabetes, your body can‚Äôt make or use insulin. Insulin
   helps change sugar into energy to keep you alive.
   There are different kinds of diabetes. The main ones are type 1 and
   type 2.
   Type 1 Diabetes
   This type of diabetes is mostly found in children and young adults. If
   you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin and you must
   inject insulin daily.
   You May:
   urinate often
   be very thirsty
   be very hungry
   lose a lot of weight
   be very tired
   be irritable
   have blurred vision
   have trouble seeing.
   Type 2 Diabetes
   Most people with diabetes have this form of the disease. Type 2 is
   usually found in people over 45, who have diabetes in their family, who
   are overweight, who don‚Äôt exercise, and who have cholesterol problems.
   It is also common in certain racial and ethnic groups (blacks, American
   Indians, and Hispanics) and in women who had diabetes when they were
   pregnant. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body cannot make enough
   insulin or correctly use it. Treatment is diabetes pills and sometimes
   insulin injections, as well as diet and exercise.
   You May Have:
   any of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes
   a lot of infections
   cuts or bruises that heal slowly
   tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
   skin, gum, or bladder infections that keep coming back.
   Controlling Diabetes
   Daily monitoring and careful control of blood sugar levels are the most
   important steps to take for people with diabetes. If not treated,
   diabetes can cause:
   High blood sugar (which could make you thirsty, tired, lose weight,
   urinate often, or give you infections that won‚Äôt go away)
   Many serious health problems (which could hurt your eyes, kidneys,
   nerves, or heart).
   Warning: Low Blood Sugar
   People with diabetes may develop low blood sugar because their blood
   has too much insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medication or from
   not eating enough food. It is important to follow the eating and
   medication schedule your doctor has prescribed to avoid low blood
   sugar.
   Low blood sugar could make you shaky, dizzy, sweaty, hungry, have a
   headache, have pale skin color, have sudden mood or behavior changes,
   have clumsy or jerky movements, have difficulty paying attention, feel
   confused, or have tingling sensations around the mouth.
   Taking Care of Your Diabetes
   The best way to take care of your diabetes is to make sure the levels
   or amount of sugar in your blood are near the normal range. This will
   make you feel better and help you stay healthy.
   Your doctor will tell you how often to check your blood sugar level. To
   do this, you will need to take a drop of your blood and place it on a
   special test strip. Then a device, called a blood glucose meter, reads
   the strip. This device measures the amount of sugar in your blood.
   Writing down this level, along with the time and date, will help you
   see how well your treatment plan is working.
   Remember:
   A person‚Äôs blood sugar level rises after eating any meal that contains
   carbohydrates or protein. Table sugar (also called ?sucrose) counts as
   a carbohydrate. Artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin, aspartame
   (NutraSweet), and sucralose (Splenda), do not count as carbohydrates or
   fats. They make food taste sweet. But they do not raise blood sugar
   levels and have little or no calories.
   What Else Can You Do?
   Eat well-balanced meals. The right amount of healthy food will keep
   your weight under control and help manage your diabetes.
   Your body needs food from the four main food groups every day:
   Fruits and vegetables (oranges, apples, bananas, carrots, and spinach)
   Whole grains, cereals, and bread (wheat, rice, oats, bran, and barley)
   Dairy products (milk, cheese, and yogurt)
   Meats, fish, poultry, eggs, dried beans, and nuts.
   Remember:
   Too much fat and cholesterol in your diet can be very harmful to people
   with diabetes. Food that is high in fat includes red meat, dairy
   products (whole milk, cream, cheese, and ice cream), egg yolks, butter,
   salad dressings, vegetable oils, and many desserts.
   Can You Do Anything Else?
   Exercise is important for good diabetes control. It usually lowers
   blood sugar and may help insulin work better. Exercise and a healthy
   diet can also help you take off extra pounds if you are overweight.
   Warning:
   Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. You may
   need a snack before or during the activity to avoid having low blood
   sugar while you exercise.

       Top Diabetes Symptoms:
       1. Weight loss
       Overly high blood sugar levels can also cause rapid weight loss,
       say 10 to 20 pounds over two or three months?but this is not a
       healthy weight loss.
       2.Hunger
       Excessive pangs of hunger, another sign of diabetes, can come from
       sharp peaks and lows in blood sugar levels.
       3.Skin problems
       Itchy skin, perhaps the result of dry skin or poor circulation, can
       often be a warning sign of diabetes, as are other skin conditions,
       such as acanthosis nigricans.
       4.Slow healing
       Infections, cuts, and bruises that don't heal quickly are another
       classic sign of diabetes.
       5.Yeast infections
       "Diabetes is considered an immunosuppressed state," Dr.
       Collazo-Clavell explains. That means heightened susceptibility to a
       variety of infections, although the most common are yeast (candida)
       and other fungal infections, she says. Fungi and bacteria both
       thrive in sugar-rich environments.
       6.Fatigue and irritability
       "When people have high blood sugar levels, depending on how long
       it's been, they can get used to chronically not feeling well," says
       Dr. Collazo-Clavell. "Sometimes that's what brings them into the
       office."
       7.Blurry vision
       Having distorted vision and seeing floaters or occasional flashes
       of light are a direct result of high blood sugar levels.
       8.Tingling or numbness
       Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, along with burning
       pain or swelling, are signs that nerves are being damaged by
       diabetes.
       9.Blood tests
       Several tests are used to check for diabetes, but a single test
       result is never enough on its own to diagnose diabetes (the test
       has to be repeated).

       Sugary drinks are terrible for you and stop them immediately. If
       you are Type II, you will have to learn to eat a balanced diet
       (control those carbs) and exercise. That thirst is a real predictor
       of diabetes. I have Type II and before I got my sugar under
       control, I had the thirst. I could drink gallons of liquid and
       still be thirsty. My mouth was dry all of the time. I understand
       that Type II diabetes is striking younger and younger people all
       the time. I don't know much about any other form of diabetes. All I
       can tell you is one of my symtoms was urine that had a strong nutty
       smell. And I went constantly. I don't remember a lot of color but
       then I take vitamins and that colors your urine. Several other
       clues may be the shape of your body. Are you an apple-the tendency
       to put weight on in your stomach rather than thighs or rearend? Do
       you have dark marks on your neck? That a sign that you are
       producing too much insulin. Do you have problems with your gums? Do
       they bleed? Another sign. There are just tons of warning signs and
       you may have one but not the other-it just depends on your body.
       Get to the doctor quickly. When you eat, your sugar should return
       to normal 2 hours after eating. If it does not, you have a problem.
       Usually when they do tests, they ask you to come in fasting so that
       is not a good test for diabetes. Do whatevery your doctor suggests
       but the best test is eat a normal meal two hours before the test
       and then see where your sugar is. If you really want to check
       yourself, go to WalMart and buy a glutrometer (the cheapest) and
       then get the strips or ask your doctor for one. He may have a free
       one but those usually use very expensive strips. It still might be
       cheaper to go to WalMart. Anyway test yourself before you eat and
       then 2 hours after you eat. Normal is 70 to 120 and they may have
       lowered that to 110. Then start checking yourself daily at
       different times before and after you eat so that you get a pretty
       good idea of where you are. It never hurts to be sure. Start
       drinking water and lay off all the sugar free stuff too. That stuff
       is terrible for you too. Water! I have Type II diabetes and you may
       contact me if I can help you in any way at anytime.

       Seeing a doctor is the right step. If diabetes is suspected your
       doctor will order some tests, so if you see these ordered in your
       blood work you'll know what the doctor is thinking.
       Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test
       Casual Plasma Glucose Test
       Hemoglobin A1c Test
       Positive diabetes test results should be confirmed by repeating the
       diabetes test on a different day.

       just mere thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination (polyuria)
       cant be alone considered to be the symptoms of dm 1 and 2 or
       diabetes insipidus ofcourse the things you have said are the
       symptoms of dm or di but you have added that your urine is pale it
       can be considered that if you take lots of water then you may pass
       lots of urine and it would be diluted
       stay cool....i have seen lots of patients without the traditional
       signs as thirst and urination...only the biochemical hematological
       annalysis such as random, fasting blood sugar levels can ascertain
       wats up in you and if its within normal some serological hormone
       levels should be checked out this can ruleout the diabetes
       insipidus......
       good luck

       Babe you drank too much coke which could be the reason your blood
       glucose levels shoot up beyong normal. It's not okay to be caught
       by Diabetes at such a young age.
       I hope you've conulted and consequently improved by the time you
       read my answer. However, you may find some supplement worth trying

       you could be even if you don't have someone in your blood line but
       maybe if you didn't go back far enough that is why you dont' know.
       if you are thirsty and very extreme tiredness that is another big
       sign. you get up from bed in the morning and still very tired like
       you didnt' sleep.

       First stop all those soft drinks, they are loaded with sugar. Sugar
       is one of the worst things you can eat. Take a look at this

   Diabetes????
   If I'm 14 years old, not overweight, no history of diabetes in the
   family, consumed lots of sugar (I used to drink lots of coke), has
   primary diabetes symptoms of thirst and lots of urination and my urine
   is pretty colorless or pale. Could I have, type 1 diabetes, type 2
   diabetes, diabetes insipidus or nothing (I'm not entirely sure I my
   thirst is real or imagined, I'm also a hypochondriac). It could be
   diabetes type 1 because I'm still 14 and it is known as the juvenile
