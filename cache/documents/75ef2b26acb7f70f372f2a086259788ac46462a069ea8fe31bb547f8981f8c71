7 Ways to Make Your Treadmill Runs More Effective

   I don’t think it’s any secret that I despise the treadmill. If I had
   the choice between banging out a five-miler on that hamster wheel or
   slogging through a snowy Central Park, I’d definitely pick the latter.
   Personal preferences aside, the treadmill can actually be a pretty
   useful tool—There I said it)—if used correctly.

   To help make my miles more manageable, and just get a better overall
   workout when I do find myself on the treadmill belt, I reached out to
   David Siik, a running coach and creator of Equinox’s treadmill training
   program [99]Precision Running. I put his tips to the test, and actually
   enjoyed my last treadmill session. Read on the see if they help you
   tread right, too.

Plan ahead

   Don’t just hop on and go. First of all, you’ll be incredibly bored and
   more likely to stop short of your goal. Instead, have a
   strategy—whether it’s speed intervals, incline intervals, or a
   combination of both. This will not only keep you engaged (and
   challenged!), but help you make real fitness strides, too. What’s more:
   You’ll probably end up logging even more miles in less time simply by
   varying your tempo.

Take your hands off the rails during inclines

   You probably see people doing this all the time. Heck, you may even do
   it yourself, but Siik says it’s a big no no. “Holding on isn’t good for
   your back, and it’s not helping you get any stronger either,” he
   explains. Feel the need to grip for dear life on? Chances are you’re
   going too fast for that particular incline. Siik’s suggestion: Slow
   your pace until you can climb without clinging on.

Step back from the display console

   Running too close to the display causes you to shorten your stride and
   run with an unnatural posture, all of which means you aren’t running as
   efficiently as you could be. So inch back and give yourself some room.
   (Don’t worry, you probably won’t fall off the back of the treadmill,
   but you can always clip the emergency stop cord to your shirt for peace
   of mind.)

Stretch your arms and shoulders first

   You may think your legs are doing all the work, but your upper body
   participates in your runs as well. “Your arms and shoulders play a
   crucial role in balancing forces created when running,” says Siik. They
   also help drive you forward, so make sure they’re warmed up and just as
   ready to work as your legs. Try this: Grab the ends of a towel with
   both hands, holding it taut behind your head. While maintaining tension
   in the towel, bend one arm, then the other, slowly moving the towel
   back and forth behind your neck.

Minimize arm swinging

   Avoid swinging your arms across the center line of your body, advises
   Siik. The goal: “Keep them parallel to your legs to create a more
   stable running form and to work your core better.” Your hands should
   move up and down, not side to side.

   RELATED: [102]15 Running Tips You Need to Know

Relax your face and hands

   Yes, running can be tough, but try not to show the strain on your face
   by scrunching it all up when you’re doing intervals. Keep things loose
   and remember to breathe. Also important: Relax your hands. This will
   reduce tension in the body, creating a more smooth and relaxed running
   form, which will allow you do to more and hurt less.

Say ‘no’ to smartphones

   These days, we all seem to be tethered to our iPhones or Androids. But
   the treadmill and these techy gadgets just don’t mix. One misstep
   caused by trying to shoot off a quick text while cruising at a 7.0
   could leave you sidelined. Plus, research shows that people who spent
   more time on their smartphones were [103]less physically fit than their
   lower-use counterparts. Limit your phone use to a rockin’ playlist.
