   squats. I'm currently using the smith machine with about 180lbs. After

   using the smith machine with about 180lbs. After the exercise (3x10
   squats) and getting some rest i find the only part of my body that is
   sore is my butt. I was hoping for pain in the legs but this never
   occurs. I'm all for a tighter behind but my goal is larger legs.
   Am i performing squats correctly using the smith machine? or should i
   be using this apparatus at all?
   Update: ** When i say leg muscles i mean my thighs.

   Best Answer:  squats are good for tightening ur bum and thigh muscles
   but if u want to work out ur legs try leg curls, walking more often or
   running or riding a bike or a cycling class (that works really well)

       It's good that you feel it in you butt because it probably means
       your technique is good (ie. knees behind toes, heels on floor
       etc.). The further you stick your butt out, the more you will work
       your butt and it also trains your body to be glute dominant which
       is good for injury prevention and triple extension of the lower
       limb. The action of the butt is to extend and flex the hip which is
       what's involved in squats, step ups etc so that's why you can feel
       it being worked.
       I suggest that you ditch the smith machine when doing squats. This
       will make your other leg muscles work harder to stabilise you.
       Also, where you position the weight effects which muscles are
       targeted. If you are doing back squats, the weight is further back
       which targets the back of your legs. If you do front squats, the
       weight is further forward which targets the front of your legs
       more. Front squats also help you to keep your balance and may a
       good option if you choose to ditch the smith machine.

       Personally if i used to squat it would be proper squats.
       I never use the smith machine. I presume that you are training on
       your own as you are you the smith machine.
       If you are doing squats you only go down to a 90 degree angle, you
       dont need to go lower than this.
       If you have just started squating it is normal to get some gluteus
       maximus discomfort, however your legs should be also feeling the
       same. With your leg work out, start by doing leg extensions to warm
       the legs up initially, then do your squats. If you widen your
       stance you will build up your inner thighs, if you narrow your
       stance you will build up your outer thighs. If you google Tom Platz
       you will see how immense thighs can look.
