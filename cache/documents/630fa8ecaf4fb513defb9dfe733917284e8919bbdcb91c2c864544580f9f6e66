   Best Answer:  Too many loops.
   You want one loop for the rows.
   for (i=1;j<=5;i++)
   and one loop for the columns
   for (j=1;j<=i;j++)
   now
   g.drawString("1",a,k);
   But this will put the number always in the same place.
   So you need to adjust a and k
   Adjust a based on i and adjust k based on j
   so
   a=10*i;
   k=10*j;
   g.drawString("1",a,k);
   but you are only printing "1" now.
   You have the number to print. It is j. But j is an int and must be
   converted to a string.
   So
   g.drawString(Integer.toString(j),a,k);
   Have fun.

       I could understand your code better if Yahoo! Answers didn't
       unformat.
       Will you reformat your code and paste it in a forum that allows you
       to use code-tags to preserve the formatting?
