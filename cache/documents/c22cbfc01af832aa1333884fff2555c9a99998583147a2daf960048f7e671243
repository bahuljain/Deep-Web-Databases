   Florian Sommet/Folio-ID
   We never appreciate how much our eyes do for usfrom helping to
   navigate the world to letting us ogle George Clooneyuntil something
   goes wrong. In fact, they're more sensitive than you think: Your eyes
   are affected by everything from makeup to air-conditioning to all those
   birthdays. Here's how to take care of them so you can keep seeing the
   sights.
   'My eyes are always itchy this time of year'
   Seasonal allergies can make your eyes itch like crazy, thanks to the
   histamine they (and other body parts) produce in response to pollen and
   other irritants.
   How to see clearly: Staying indoors with the windows shut is ideal, but
   we know you can't be a total recluse. So use over-the-counter allergy
   eyedrops such as Naphcon-A, or ask your doc to prescribe a more potent
   one such as Pataday, says Anne Sumers, MD, a clinical correspondent for
   the American Academy of Ophthalmology. And shower before bed so
   pollen's not lingering on your face and in your hair all night long.
   'Why are my lids pink and puffy?'
   If one or both of your eyelids are inflamed, itchy, and red, you may
   have blepharitis, which occurs when bacteria or excessive oil from your
   eyes coats the lid near the eyelash line. It can also be caused by
   allergies. "Blepharitis, which is not contagious and usually doesn't
   require antibiotics, often gets mistaken for pink eye, which is usually
   caused by a virus and is highly infectious," Dr. Sumers says. Check in
   with an eye doctor to figure out which one you've got. A pink eyelid
   can also mean you have a sty, a bacterial infection on your lid that
   takes the form of a painful, pus-filled pimple.
   How to see clearly: Prevent and treat both styes and blepharitis by
   keeping the eye clean. Soak a washcloth with warm water, wring it out,
   and place it over your closed eye for a minute or two. Do this two or
   three times a day. "Clean all your eye makeup off every night," Dr.
   Sumers adds, "and never wear eyeliner inside your lash line." And no
   matter how tempted you are, don't pop a sty, or you could spread the
   infection.
   'My eyes are burning!'
   If you feel a gritty, scratchy, or even stabbing pain in your eyes, you
   may be one of the 10 million Americans suffering from dry eye syndrome.
   Blame modern life: Air-conditioning and central heating can leave eyes
   parched, says Stephanie Marioneaux, MD, an ophthalmologist in
   Chesapeake, Virginia. Plus, studies have shown that when we stare at a
   screen, we don't blink as often, so our eyes lose their natural
   lubrication. If you wear contact lenses, you're more prone; same goes
   if you smoke or take medications such as antihistamines or
   decongestants.
   How to see clearly: Try artificial tears. "Gels that are labeled 'for
   severe dry eye,' such as Systane, are thicker and last longer, but they
   can feel gummy and blur vision," Dr. Sumers says. "Drops that are
   labeled 'mild to moderate,' such as Refresh, are thinner and feel
   better, but won't last as long."
   If drops don't do the trick, your doctor can prescribe a topical
   medication or fit you with punctal plugs (they're inserted into your
   eye to keep tears from draining too quickly). Use a vaporizer or
   humidifier to keep indoor air moist, too. Surprisingly, eating fish
   high in omega-3 fatty acidssuch as salmon, sardines, and tunamay
   reduce your risk of dry eye, and taking flaxseed oil and omega-3
   supplements may relieve symptoms, studies suggest. And every 10 minutes
   or so, look away from your computer or tablet screen and bat your lids
   like Scarlett O'Hara.
