The No-Squat, No-Lunge Butt Workout

   Summer is almost here so it’s time to break out the bikini—maybe even
   one with tiny, Brazilian-cut bottoms! Not quite ready to show off your
   booty? Don’t worry: It only takes 10 minutes a day to get it beach
   ready. Try this quick, creative [99]butt workout to lift and tone your
   derriere. No squats, no lunges, but you’ll definitely still feel the
   burn!

   1. Diagonal donkey kicks
   This variation on regular [100]donkey kicks is more intense and works
   your outer thighs, hips, and glutes. Get into a tabletop position with
   your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your back flat. From
   here, kick your right leg behind you at a diagonal, pushing your heel
   up toward the ceiling and away from your body. Once you’ve reached a
   full extension, bring your leg out to the side in a swooping motion,
   keeping your leg parallel to the ground. From here, rotate back to the
   diagonal stance. Remember to keep your abs engaged! Do 20 to 25 reps,
   then switch legs. Do 3 sets total. Make it harder by wearing ankle
   weights.

   2. Swiss ball Supermans
   Bend over a Swiss ball so that your stomach is resting on the ball and
   your hands and feet are touching the ground. Using your hands for
   balance, engage your glutes and lift your feet off the ground to come
   into a modified [101]Superman. Hold for 3 counts, and lower back down
   to the ground. Do 3 sets of 10.

   3. Banded tabletop kicks
   Get into a tabletop position. Hold one end of a [102]resistance band
   with handles in each hand. Place the other handle of the band around
   the bottom of your right foot. Keeping your back straight, kick your
   right leg back behind you. Next, bring your knee back in toward your
   chest without letting it touch the ground. Repeat for 20 reps on your
   right leg, and then switch to your left. Do 3 sets.

   4. Glute blaster with band
   Lie on your back with your knees bent. Extend one leg up into the air,
   and loop a resistance band around the bottom of that foot. Keeping the
   band taut, squeeze your glutes and push yourself up into a [103]bridge,
   raising your hips up off the ground. Hold for a count, and lower back
   down. Repeat for 20 reps, then switch legs. Do 3 sets.
