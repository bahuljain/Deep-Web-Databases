   We’ve been keeping tabs on [99]Mo’ne Davis, the 13-year-old, 70-mph
   fastball-throwing wonder child since last summer. (In case you’ve been
   living under a rock, Davis, a member of Taney Dragons, pitched the
   first-ever shutout by a girl in a Little League World Series game.)

   Off the mound, she has continued to make headlines: She landed the
   [100]cover of [101]Sports Illustrated, and filmmaker Spike Lee directed
   the mini-doc [102]Throw Like a Girl, based on Davis’ life. Her memoir,
   [103]Remember My Name, was released last week, and she has a
   [104]Disney Channel biopic in the works.

   While her pitching skills may have afforded her these remarkable
   opportunities, Davis has made it her mission to step up to the plate
   outside of baseball as well. She recently teamed up with the socially
   conscious company M4D3 (Make A Difference Everyday), in connection with
   the [105]Because I Am a Girl, whose goal is to provide economic and
   educational opportunities to girls around the world, to create a line
   of lifestyle [106]sneakers for women and girls.

   “I never thought at the age of 13 I’d be a role model, but having young
   girls look up to me is pretty cool,” Davis said in statement obtained
   by Elle.com. “If I can inspire them to reach their goals, that would be
   even cooler. Designing shoes with M4D3 is exciting and I wanted them to
   support Because I’m a Girl to help girls and give them [107]a chance at
   a better future.”

   The details on these limited edition Mo’ne Davis high tops show just
   how much love went into crafting them. Designed with baseball stitching
   and available in three colors (pink, white, and blue), each pair sports
   a “throw like a girl” patch on the back.

   The shoes will launch in June with a price point of $75 (pre-order at
   [108]made-shoes.com), and 15% of the proceeds will go to Plan
   International’s Because I Am a Girl initiative, which helps
   poverty-stricken girls around the world. So you’ll be doing some good
   while kicking around town in these sweet kicks.

   “We are creating a shoe that we know Mo’ne fans will love and be proud
   of, and that will Make A Difference Everyday. Together with Mo’ne, we
   are designing a shoe that represents who she is; contemporary, spirited
   and athletic, but at the same time being very caring towards other
   girls and young women that are vulnerable around the world,” added Lisa
   Zbitnew, a M4D3 spokeswoman, in the statement.

   What will Davis throw our way next? Who knows. Right now we’re just
   happy to have another positive female out there to look up to.
