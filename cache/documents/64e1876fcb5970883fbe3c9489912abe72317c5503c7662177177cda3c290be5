Signs You're Not Eating Enough Fat

   Signs You ºre Not Eating Enough Fat

   Photo: Getty + Dean Belcher

   By Elizabeth Narins

   The whole fat-free diet craze of the 1990s really messed up the way
   people think about healthy eating. But the truth is, the kind of fat
   you eat isn‚Äôt the same kind that makes your pants feel tight ‚Äî and your
   body absolutely needs the delicious kind of fat to function properly.
   While your activity level, age, and current health status determine
   exactly how much fat you should eat, the government‚Äôs  [80]daily
   allowance for most women is the equivalent of five or six teaspoons of
   oil from food sources like avocado, peanut butter, nuts, seeds,
   margarine, mayo, and salad dressing. (See how many teaspoons of oil are
   in each of these foods  [81]here.)

   If you‚Äôre not into counting and measuring, consider these signs to
   gauge whether you‚Äôre getting enough fat:

   1. You‚Äôre starving. Or at least it feels that way ‚Äî even after you ate
   a seemingly sizable meal. Because your body takes a longer time to
   processes fat than it does to digest carbs, meals that include fat help
   keep you feeling full for longer, says Anne Mauney, a registered
   dietitian based in Washington D.C.

   2. Your skin has seen better days. If it‚Äôs especially dry, flaky, dull,
   or it looks older than you are, lack of dietary fat could be the
   culprit, says Lori Welstead, M.S., a registered dietitian at the
   University of Chicago Medicine in Chicago, Illinois. While you might
   have heard that greasy food messes with your skin, healthy fats help
   you absorb the fat-soluble vitamins in other foods you eat that help
   your skin maintain moisture. So without, say, dressing on your salad,
   your body can only utilize so much of the other nutrients you eat. Your
   skin could bear the brunt of it.

   Weight

   3. Your period is MIA. Your body uses dietary fat to regulate your
   hormones, so skimping on it can mess with your cycle, Welstead says.
   (Note: Diet isn‚Äôt the only thing that can make your period disappear.
   If things feel out of whack, check in with your gyno before you
   self-diagnose.)

   4. You seriously can‚Äôt focus. One gram of fat contains twice as many
   calories as one gram of carbs or protein. (It‚Äôs why fatty foods
   generally contain more calories than protein or carbs.) While it‚Äôs
   totally possible to consume enough calories from carbs and protein
   alone, people who are super careful about avoiding foods with fat could
   unintentionally under-eat. And who can think about anything but food on
   an empty stomach?

   5. You‚Äôre extra anxious and maybe even a little depressed. While there
   could be other factors at play here, Welstead says skimping on
   essential fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6 can make you feel blah.
   Fish, flax seeds, and chia seeds are good food sources. If anxiety
   comes out of nowhere, or you can‚Äôt knock your bad moods, try eating two
   weekly servings of fatty fish such as salmon, fresh tuna, or sardines,
   if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing, and see if things improve.

   6. You suffer from sensory overload at crowded bars and malls. In a
   2009 [85]study conducted by the American Psychological Association,
   researchers fed mice different amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and
   exposed the animals to a soft tone, then a loud one. (The soft one is
   meant to prep the mice so they expect the second sound. If all goes
   according to plan, they flinch less when they hear the louder noise.)
   Mice who ate sufficient amounts of omega-3 kept their cool throughout
   the tests, while deficient mice sort of freaked out. Researchers say
   that omega-3 deficiency could reduce your ability to handle sensory
   input.

   7. You‚Äôre fit, but you basically collapse after 20 minutes of exercise.
   If you exercise regularly and lose steam more quickly than usual, your
   diet could be one of the reasons why. During exercise, your body burns
   carbs from food first, then relies on calories from fat to keep you
   going, according to [86]Medline Plus, which could leave fat-free
   dieters SOL.

   8. You remember nothing. Large-scale [87]studies on older populations
   suggest that high-fat diets that contain olive oil, nuts, fish, and
   other classic Mediterranean foods can help preserve memory. If you‚Äôre
   pretty much losing it now and you don‚Äôt eat much fat, connect the dots,
   and start eating up.
