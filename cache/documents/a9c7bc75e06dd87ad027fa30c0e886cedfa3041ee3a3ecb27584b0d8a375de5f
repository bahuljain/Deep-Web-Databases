What is the best graphics card for an AGP 4x slot?

   Hi,
   I currently have an ATI Radeon 64MB graphics card. I have recently
   started using a simulator game, but the graphics card is struggling to
   keep up. What would I be able to upgrade to using the AGP 4x slot?
   Thanks,
   Neil.

   Best Answer:  the issue is one of voltage, some of the older cards
   required 5v then they modified it to 3v but the pin layout stayed the
   same, you can put 5v cards in a 3v based slot but not the other way
   around. That said most x4 cards were the newer regulation voltage so
   you can get any x8 card (as they are far easier to find) and it will
   run at the lower x4 speed. It does compromise its full potential but
   should be far better than what you currently have.
   The HD 3850 is perhaps the fastest card of its type or the HD4670 runs
   it a close second though both are not so easy to source anymore.
   I did find a 1Gb AGP card here
   [120]http://www.ebuyer.com/222076-his-hd-4670... that will do the trick
   but you do need to check your PSU is capable. Be sure to check the
   images against your card to ensure that the notch (the cutout) is in
   the same place.

       While upgrading the system would probably be a better investment in
       the long run, you could consider the HIS Radeon HD 4670 1GB 128-bit
       DDR3 AGP 4X/8X HDCP Ready Video Card. The card runs $112 on NewEgg.
       I'd only go this route if you plan to keep your current system for
       a another 1+ years though since the card wouldn't be compatible
       with modern systems that use PCI-Express. Your better option would
       be to look for a used high end NVIDIA AGP video card that you could
       hopefully pick up for < $50 and hope it last until you can get
       around to a system upgrade.

       depends what operating system + machine you are talking about..
       for mac os 9:
       4x AGP slots on a mac, some of the best cards include Radeon 8500 +
       Geforce 4 Ti 4400.. The 4600 being a bit better.. and the actual
       best 4x AGP card for a powermac g4 Quicksilver or MDD.
       for powermac g5:
       Gefoce 6800 or Radeon X850 XT are the best
       if you are asking for a PC, the options open up ALOT past the
       limitations of os9 and AGP osx but again still depends on what
       operating system..windows98 of course has a cut off where drivers
       stopped being developed... Windows XP ..tons of options. windows
       7.. u have to check to be sure..but most cards from 2008+ will be
       supported

       hi neil
       agp cards are becoming harder and harder to buy... and thats the x8
       cards... that said a agp x8 card will run in a agp x4 slot but only
       at the x4 speed.... but core and memory clock speeds stay the same
       and also power requirements
       im currently using a radeon HD5750 however when i had a agp based
       system the last card i had was the excellent "sapphire radeon
       HD3850 agp " which is still known as the fastest agp card you can
       buy... however you do need a 450w or better power supply with at
       least 26A or more on the +12v rails
       your power supply also needs a 6pin pci-express power connector ..
       but dont worry if your psu does not have one as you get a adapter
       with the card to transform a molex connector to a 6pin connector
       ive looked around and the best deal on this card can be found at
       [130]http://compare.ebay.co.uk/like/150524498... ... for ¬£46
       however another agp card worth considering is the "HIS HD 4670 IceQ
       Edition "( [131]http://www.ebuyer.com/222076-his-hd-4670... )...
       this has a 750mhz core clock and 1gb of ddr3 memory running at
       1700mhz ddr effective.... theres also a 128bit memory interface and
       direct x 10 support...... but the best part of this card is the
       cooler.... and like other HIS branded cards its uv reactive when
       you have cold cathod lighting in your case
       allthough the HD3850 is the better card the above card is the best
       option for you.... and compared to your current 64mb card there
       will be a massive boost in performance
       i hope this helps neil... however any questions let me know
       good luck mate !

       Look for the highest performance AGP ATI Radeon graphics card. The
       best I know (and I only know a couple) is ATI Radeon 9000 Pro
       (256mb I think).

       Not really much of an answer but you should try upgrading your
       motherboard such that it supports PCI Express 2.0 slot. You won't
       get a real good card to cope up with nowadays games until you get
       that. Then depending on the budget, check out Tomshardware reviews
       on best cards of the month. I can suggest you a great card for
       around 200$, MSI's (GTX 560 Ti Twin Frozr) / OC.
       Sorry but yeah, thats the only good way to upgrade nowadays.

       Hi,
       This is a good link for downloading Prince of Persia Warrior Within
       for free: http://bit.ly/1oh9a3O
       The second installment in the Prince of Persia trilogy is here and
       it?s full of dark surprises. Ubisoft Montreal developers have
       outdone themselves with this suite to the critically acclaimed
       Sands of Time.

       hi
       the MSI NX6800-TD128 GeForce 6800 128MB DDR TV-Out/DVI (AGP) (
       http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=BG-049-MS&grou
       pid=595&catid=683&subcat= ) ... is a pretty good agp card and has
       some decent specs for a agp card .... it also comes with 2 games (
       URU, XIII and Prince of Persia )
       compared to your current agp card this is pretty decent ... and
       even if its for just 6 months its not bad for the price
       hope this helps
       good luck mate
