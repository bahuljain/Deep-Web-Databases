Fats You Canand ShouldEat

Think you have to go low fat? Not anymore: New research has turned this
nutritional bad guy into a must-eat. Ahead, the good news.

   It's just not fair: Fat got a bad rap decades ago because scientists
   assumed, based on the misinterpretation of a couple of large studies,
   that eating foods containing fat would lead directly to obesity and
   heart disease. Fatty foods were made out to be our sole dietary vice,
   responsible for raising our cholesterol levels, clogging our arteries,
   and causing us to get, well, fat.
   And that made a kind of intuitive sensewhy wouldn't the fat you
   consume wind up as the fat you see on your butt and thighs? But "the
   low-fat diet backfired," says Frank Hu, MD, professor of nutrition and
   epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. "America's obesity
   epidemic skyrocketed even while our fat intake went down." So experts
   are getting off the "fat is evil" bandwagon these daysand we should,
   too.
   The upside of eating fat
   Like carbohydrates and protein, fat is an essential nutrient. This
   means that your body requires it for key functions, such as absorbing
   the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. "Fat is also an important
   energy source and is vital for keeping your skin and hair healthy and
   smooth," says Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD, author of Read It Before You Eat It.
   Even more surprising: Research is revealing that eating the right fats
   can actually lower your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity,
   and improve your cholesterol levels. That's because all fats are not
   created equal, Dr. Hu points out. It's not the total amount of fat in
   your diet that affects how much you weigh or whether you're at risk for
   heart disease, according to rigorous studies from the past decade. What
   matters is the type of fats you choose (and, when it comes to dropping
   pounds, the total number of calories you eat). Here's a breakdown.
   Good fats
   Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)
   Found in plant foods like nuts, avocados, olive oil, and canola oil,
   and in poultry
   MUFAs can actually lower cholesterol levels, and, in doing so, your
   risk of heart disease. In fact, a Journal of the American Medical
   Association study showed that replacing a carb-rich diet with one high
   in monounsaturated fats can do both, and reduce blood pressure, too.
   Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
   Found in fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel, and corn and soybean
   oils
   Like MUFAs, PUFAs have been shown to improve cholesterol levels and
   reduce heart disease risk. One type is the omega-3 fatty acid, which is
   plentiful in some kinds of fishnot to be confused with omega-6 fatty
   acids, found in meats, corn oil, and soybean oil. Some research finds
   that Americans eat about 20 times more omega-6 than omega-3; we should
   be aiming to get closer to four times as much. To do so, Dr. Hu says,
   sub in fish for meat when you can.
   Ok-in-moderation fat
   Saturated fat
   Found in meat and dairy products such as cheese, butter, and milk
   We've been warned for decades to eat less saturated fatafter all, it
   raises "bad" (LDL) cholesterol levels, and thus, it was assumed, ups
   your risk of heart attack and stroke. Lately, though, research has
   begun to vindicate it. For instance, a 2010 American Journal of
   Clinical Nutrition review of 21 studies was unable to find a link
   between saturated fat consumption and heart disease or stroke. Some
   types have been entirely exonerated: "Stearic acid, found in dark
   chocolate, is clearly non-harmful," says David L. Katz, MD, director of
   the Yale University Prevention Research Center. The same may be true of
   lauric acid, a type of saturated fat abundant in coconut oil, but
   there's not enough evidence to say for sure, Dr. Katz says.
   While some experts, like Dr. Katz, say there's no downside to cutting
   out saturated fats, others believe keeping them in the mix helps us
   avoid getting too many bad-for-you refined carbohydrates instead.
   Bottom line: You don't need to ban them. Just make sure most of your
   fat intake is unsaturated, eat red meat only once or twice a week, and
   use olive oil instead of butter when possible.
