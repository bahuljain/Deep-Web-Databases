The DASH Diet Is The Best Diet In America ‚Äî So Why Haven't You Heard Of It?

   The DASH Diet Is The Best Diet In America ‚Äî So Why Haven ºt You Heard Of
   It?

   When U.S. News & World Report‚Äôs ranking of the [82]35 Best and Worst
   Diets was published on Tuesday, the top choice left readers scratching
   their heads. America‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù diet wasn‚Äôt the popular [83]Mediterranean
   diet or the oft-Instagrammed [84]Paleo diet. The No. 1 spot went to the
   [85]DASH Diet, an under-the-radar eating plan that was developed to
   fight high blood-pressure, but  just so happens to help shed pounds as
   well. Even more impressive: U.S. News gave the diet top grades for a
   whopping fifth year in a row.

   So what is the DASH diet? ‚ÄúDASH‚Äù stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop
   Hypertension. The diet comes in three variations‚Äîoriginal, weight loss
   oriented, and vegetarian‚Äîand promises to lower blood pressure and
   reduce risk of cancer, heart disease, heart failure, kidney stones, and
   diabetes. Sound lofty? Take a look at the diet‚Äôs history: in 1992, the
   National Institutes of Health (NIH) set out to create a guideline that
   would stop hypertension and prevent heart disease. The NIH spent six
   years carrying out two diverse, dual-gendered, university-backed
   studies which confirmed what they had guessed: Dietary patterns can ‚Äî
   and do ‚Äî affect blood pressure. Researchers and doctors put together a
   list of nutritional guidelines based on their findings, creating the
   first iteration of the DASH diet.

   ‚ÄúThe core DASH diet foods are plentiful amounts of fruits and
   vegetables, low-fat and nonfat dairy, and nuts, beans, and seeds. To
   this we add more healthy foods, including lean meats, fish, poultry,
   eggs, mostly whole grains and heart healthy fats.‚Äù Marla Heller, RD,
   DASH dietitian and author of the new [87]The DASH Diet Younger You,
   tells Yahoo Health. The most recent version of the diet advocates
   choosing fresh, non-GMO foods that are low in salt and sugar and
   emphasize potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber.

   Why is No. 1? ‚ÄúThe DASH diet tops the list of best diets because of its
   health benefits,‚Äù says Heller. ‚ÄúIt lowers blood pressure, cholesterol,
   reduces the risk for heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, some
   cancers, kidney stones, and can reverse or prevent type 2 diabetes. No
   other diet has this kind of scientific pedigree.‚Äù

   From a nutritional standpoint, the diet hits all the guidelines
   generally recommended by doctors to shed pounds and improve health. It
   doesn‚Äôt cut out any major food groups (like the grain-shunning
   Whole30), and it doesn‚Äôt overemphasize any one macronutrient (fat,
   carbohydrates, or protein).

   In a pool filled with extreme diets, DASH is resoundingly gimmick-free.
   It‚Äôs also incredibly flexible. Don‚Äôt like the foods in the meal plan?
   Swap them out for one of the potassium-, magnesium-, and calcium-rich
   foods on the DASH diet substitutions list.

   It‚Äôs worth noting that while the DASH diet‚Äôs principles have evolved
   since its mid-90‚Äôs inception, some guidelines seem to contradict recent
   nutritional developments. [89]Butter made a public comeback in 2014
   (some experts even called it the food of the year), but the DASH diet
   pushes nonfat or low-fat dairy instead. Full-fat advocates argue that
   whole, unaltered milk is easier to digest for those who are sensitive
   to lactose, while DASH suggests that lactose-intolerant dieters might
   be better able to handle skim milk rather that whole milk.

   The DASH diet does shun sugar, [90]deemed ‚Äúevil‚Äù by all but
   banana-loving fruitarians, and echoes recent suggestions to reduce red
   meat consumption. Heller says the latest version of the diet ‚Äútakes
   advantage of updated DASH research, which showed improved blood
   pressure results by cutting back on the refined carbs and added
   sugars.‚Äù

   Why haven‚Äôt you heard of it? While other diets offer get-slim-quick
   tricks that seem (and often are) too good to be true, the DASH diet
   slides under the radar with calm, rational guidelines and
   easy-to-follow instructions. People aren‚Äôt publicizing it because
   frankly, it‚Äôs a little boring. It‚Äôs not grueling enough for a
   #30DayChallenge‚Äîand even if it were, DASH experts think you‚Äôll want to
   stick around a little longer once you see and feel the results.
