   3 Tips for Following Low-Carb Diets LiveScience.com Monday, September
   29, 2014
   By Deborah Enos, CN, Columnist
   Doesn't it seem like a new fad diet pops up every day? One may think
   that we would eventually run out of food combinations, but new trends
   just keep emerging. Many of them are variations on the same core
   principles â€” and any way you cut it, low-carb and low-fat diets are
   still all the rage. But do they work?
   A small study published this month in the journal Annals of Internal
   Medicine found that obese adults assigned to a [2]low-carbohydrate diet
   lost more weight over a year than those on a low-fat plan. It is
   important to note, though, that this study excluded exercise. In fact,
   the study's participants were not permitted to exercise during the
   one-year period, so a true comparison could be made between the two
   diets alone. But carbohydrates act as fuel for the body, so adding
   exercise to the mix may have drastically changed the outcome.
   Before you jump on the low-carb bandwagon, you should know that
   following a low-carb diet may impact [3]your sleep patterns. People on
   a very low carbohydrate diet may spend less time in deep, REM sleep
   compared with those who eat more carbs, according to a 2008 study in
   the journal Nutritional Neuroscience. The study only followed
   participants for 48 hours, so the longer-term effects remain unclear,
   but the findings do suggest that sleep is affected in the short term by
   eating a low-carb diet.
   This study serves as a reminder that weight loss does not necessarily
   equate to optimal health. And even the term "low-carb" can refer to a
   myriad of diets from an Atkins-style bacon fest to a more balanced diet
   that includes a variety of vegetables. [[4]7 Biggest Diet Myths]
   If you want to take advantage of the [5]weight-loss benefits of a
   low-carb diet, but still consume a balanced diet, here are three tips
   to consider:
   1. Be wary of exclusions. There's no danger in excluding things like
   MSG or hydrogenated fats from your diet, but if a diet recommends
   completely excluding a certain food group, proceed with caution.
   2. Remember that all carbohydrates aren't the enemy. When you hear
   someone say that carbs make them fat, they are probably talking about
   things like white flour and sugar. Vegetables also contain certain
   forms of carbohydrates, and they contain a great deal of vitamins and
   minerals that the body needs.
   3. Evaluate your progress frequently. Are you hungry all the time?
   Grouchy or [6]sleep deprived? When you start eating healthier, you
   should also start feeling better. If you aren't, the diet that you are
   following may not be the best fit for you. Don't fall into the trap of
   getting stuck on a diet just because you're losing weight. You should
   also be feeling well.
