Knee, Hip Replacement Surgeries Linked to Heart Risks

   August 31, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [knee_replacement.jpg]

   By Steven Reinberg
   HealthDay Reporter

   MONDAY, Aug. 31, 2015 (HealthDay News) — People who have total hip or
   knee replacement surgery face a greater risk for a heart attack during
   the first month following the procedure, a new study finds.

   The chances of a heart attack were more than eight times greater in the
   first 30 days after total knee replacement surgery compared to people
   who didn’t have the procedure. The risk of a heart attack was four
   times greater during the month following total hip replacement surgery,
   the study revealed.

   But the researchers noted that the findings shouldn’t deter people from
   having these surgeries.

   “Overall, neither knee or hip replacement increases the risk of heart
   attack over the entire follow-up period in our study, even though the
   risk was substantially increased shortly after surgery,” he said. “This
   risk should not keep a patient from having either surgery.”

   Indeed, the odds of a heart attack dissipated over time in these
   patients, the study found. However, the odds of blood clots in veins
   and lungs increased in the month following surgery and lasted for years
   after knee or hip replacement was performed, the researchers said.

   “Contrary to recently published findings, our study indicates that
   total joint replacement procedures do not provide an overall protective
   effect on the risk of heart attack,” said lead researcher Yuqing Zhang,
   a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University School of
   Medicine.

   These findings suggest that the risk for heart attack immediately after
   surgery may have been underestimated, he said.

   Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of
   California, Los Angeles, said, “It is well documented that during and
   early after a variety of surgical procedures that the risk of a heart
   attack is elevated.”

   An earlier study of patients with osteoarthritis comparing those who
   did or did not undergo knee or hip replacement suggested that there was
   lower risk for heart attacks among those having surgery, according to
   background information in the study. However, heart attacks in the
   month after surgery were excluded from that study, skewing the results,
   Fonarow said.

   “The reasons for increased risk of heart attack for these and other
   types of surgery are many, and to date approaches such as use of heart
   medications, such as aspirin, beta blockers and alpha blockers, have
   generally not been successful in lowering the risk,” he said.

   Zhang said that measures may need to be taken to reduce the risk of a
   heart attack after surgery.

   The findings were published Aug. 31 in the journal Arthritis &
   Rheumatology.

   For the study, Zhang and colleagues collected data on nearly 14,000
   people over the age of 50 with osteoarthritis who had a total knee
   replacement. They compared these patients with a similar number of
   people who didn’t have the procedure. They also collected data on more
   than 6,000 people over the age of 50 with osteoarthritis who had a
   total hip replacement and compared them with a similar number of people
   who didn’t have one.

   Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis; it affects 27
   million Americans over 25, according to the U.S. National Institute of
   Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disorder
   causes joint pain and stiffness.

   In some cases, hip or knee replacement may be a good option for
   patients with osteoarthritis to relieve pain and stiffness and restore
   mobility, NIAMS said. As many as 1.8 million hip or knee replacements
   are performed each year worldwide, background information from the
   study noted.

   Fonarow said that following a heart-healthy lifestyle is the best way
   to reduce the risk of a heart attack during and after an operation.

   “Doctors and patients can take steps to substantially lower the risk of
   heart attacks by maintaining a healthy blood pressure, cholesterol
   level, body weight, and by exercising and not smoking,” Fonarow said.
   “In addition, statins are one of the most effective therapies to
   minimize risk.”
