   once, together with Windows and Office. Recently I had to run it
   several times to remove some pesky malware, and when I update it it
   says the realtime protection is not working anymore. I removed it and
   put Malwarebytes Anti-Malware in place, but I miss the realtime
   protection. They too have the option, but it is not free - yet there is
   an option to enter a coupon code and probably take it cheaper.
   Should I keep looking for a coupon code or just take the hit and
   purchase it at full price?

   Best Answer:  Hi, there
   You are absolutely right, the realtime module in Anti-malware is
   activated only for the full (paid) version.
   There are coupons available from time to time, but mostly to
   beta-testers and veteran users. Some of these coupons are shared online
   freely - check [120]http://news.dtcdeals.com/malwarebytes/do... for
   example.
   Googling for a Malwarebytes coupon code is futile - valid Malwarebytes
   coupon codes are quickly used and expire after short periods of time.
   You can try to buy the Malwarebytes Antimalware app even if you don't
   have a Malwarebytes voucher - you will get updates for life and a solid
   piece of software to help you against malware. Good luck!

       Malwarebytes is not meant for realtime just to tell you first of
       all. You can search and get some legit coupon, but mostly are
       adware/virus sites. Just pay the full site from official site for
       safest part. If you are searching for good spyware protection just
       get a full suite such as kaspersky, norton, or trend. If you want a
       free good one is usually superantispyware or you can get the pro
       for better database and detection.

       CNet's Download.com has an offer where if you purchase via their
       link, you get 10% off.

       Also, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware has always had an optional
       real-time protection component, and it was never meant not to have
       it. It's just that you have to purchase a license to unlock it.
