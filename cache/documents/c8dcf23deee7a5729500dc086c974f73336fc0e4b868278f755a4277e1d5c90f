   If I had a nickel for every time a female client told me they
   [99]didn’t want to lift weights for fear of “getting bulky,” let’s just
   say I would have lots of nickels. While, yes, there is a purpose for
   dieting and cardio, the truth is that lean muscle cannot survive on the
   treadmill alone. In my experience, weight training still seems to be
   the biggest-kept secret for fat loss.

   You should know that unless you’re taking supplements to enhance muscle
   growth you won’t get bulky, because your body simply doesn’t have the
   hormones to get there naturally. Cardio only burns calories while
   you’re performing it, but strength training has what is known as the
   afterburn effect. Thanks to “Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption”
   or EPOC, your [100]metabolism remains elevated even after you’re done
   exercising. A well-designed strength-training program can keep you
   burning calories and fat for up to 48 hours after your workout.

   Here are four things your fitness regimen should include, plus a sample
   workout schedule.

Pure strength training

   True to the way it sounds, this part of the program is designed
   specifically to build or maintain muscle mass. The [101]more muscle you
   have, the faster your metabolism will be, and the more calories and fat
   your body will burn. Your body type and level of expertise will
   determine how much weight you should be lifting and for how long. If
   you’re more advanced you can get away with lifting heavier loads,
   whereas if you’re just starting out, start with lighter weights (or no
   weights) and then add on once you’ve mastered the movement itself. My
   new book [102]Strong is the New Skinny has a step-by-step guide for
   each fitness level, plus tons of strength training exercises to choose
   from to keep both your mind and body guessing. If you can only get to
   the gym 3 days a week, use those days to do your pure strength
   training. You can [103]create a 5-move workout here or try these
   [104]bodyweight exercises.

   A tip for strength training: Don’t weigh yourself. When you lift
   weights, the numbers on the scale may fluctuate. You may be losing fat,
   but gaining toned muscle. Would you rather see the number on the scale
   go down or would you rather lose inches and have your clothing fit
   better even if you weigh a little more? It really should be no contest.

Metabolic resistance training

   Metabolic resistance training (MRT) is also sometimes referred to as
   HIIT or [106]high-intensity interval training. Either way you spin it,
   the main concept is that you’re performing periods of intense work,
   followed by a short period of rest. When done correctly, MRT can be the
   best way to skyrocket that heart rate and keep your body burning fat
   throughout the rest of the day. But, since the work is so quick and
   intense, form is of the essence. Respect your ability level—if you know
   you’ve already exhausted your arms from a set of burpees, don’t go for
   the [107]squat with overhead press. Keep in mind that there are a
   number of ways to perform these types of exercises, whether it’s
   [108]dumbbells, [109]kettlebells, or body weight exercises like
   [110]mountain climbers or [111]push-ups. For more ideas, check out
   [112]The 15-Minute Workout to Change Fat to Muscle.

Cardio

   Although cardio shouldn’t be your only source of physical activity,
   there is still a place for it in your overall fitness regimen. Cardio
   can be done two ways: moderate intensity or high intensity as a form of
   interval training. It all depends where your heart rate is. Moderate
   intensity (heart rate in about the 120-150 range) is good for improving
   your overall aerobic base, as well as improving your recovery
   throughout the week as your body gets rid of any lactic acid build up
   from resistance training. Use it as a warm-up before your strength
   training days, about 10 to 15 minutes just to get the body moving. Or,
   you can use it as a MRT workout, getting your heart rate up to about
   90% of its maximum effort and then recovering with a rest period. Try
   doing sets of 100 jump ropes as fast as you can, resting for 30 seconds
   to a minute in between. Or, run intervals on the treadmill: sprint for
   a minute and then walk for a minute. For an added challenge, try
   increasing the incline by 1% each time.

Rest

   Your rest days are just as important as the days you’re going all out.
   When you work your muscles to the point of exhaustion, you’re
   essentially breaking apart the muscle fibers. In order to let them
   rebuild, you need to allow them the time to heal. If you’re working out
   every day, you’re not giving your body the time it needs to repair and
   rebuild. You could potentially be doing more harm than good if you
   refuse to take a day off, so it’s important to take adequate rest days
   as a part of your program.

A sample program:

   Monday: Moderate intensity cardio warmup + pure strength training

   Tuesday: MRT

   Wednesday: Moderate intensity cardio warmup + pure strength training

   Thursday: MRT intervals (treadmill or [113]jump rope)

   Friday: Moderate intensity cardio warmup + pure strength training

   Saturday: MRT

   Sunday: Rest
