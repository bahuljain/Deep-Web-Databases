Take the 30-Day Cardio Challenge

   Here are a few scary statistics. According to the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), about 715,000 Americans have a heart
   attack every year. About 600,000 people die from heart disease in the
   United States each year—that’s 1 out of 4 deaths. And heart disease is
   the leading cause of death for both men and women.

   The good news, almost all risk factors associated with heart disease
   are lifestyle related. That means eating, moving and thinking right can
   literally add years to your life.

   How? Cardiovascular-interval training is one excellent way to
   strengthen your ticker. Cardio intervals are short bursts of intense
   exercise that get your heart pumping, lungs working and body moving.

   More: [98]How to Find Your Target Heart Rate Training Zone

   The five exercises listed below not only get your heart rate up, but
   they also strengthen muscles from head to toe.

   Bust through any fitness plateau and keep your heart ticking strong
   with this month-long challenge.

   How To Do The 30-Day Cardio Challenge

   At the end of your regular exercise routine, add at least one set of
   each of the following exercises. Aim for at least 30 seconds per
   exercise for week one and increase by at least 15 seconds each week.
   Time your intervals and record them on your tracker.
     * Burpees
     * Bicycle Crunches
     * Jump Squats
     * Ski Jumps
     * Mountain Climbers

   If you don’t have a regular routine or are short on time, do these
   moves as a quick circuit. Make sure to do an easy warm up for 5 to 10
   minutes (walk, run, bike) and cool down for about five minutes with
   some easy stretching. These five exercises are body weight movements,
   so you have lots of control over the intensity of each move.

   [99]Watch this quick video for exercise instructions and modifications.

   Note: Always check with your doctor before starting any new exercise
   routine.

30-Day Cardio Challenge Instructions


   1. You can do these moves as many times as you like each week. You can
   do as many rounds as you would like, but you must commit to at least
   one round four days per week to do the challenge correctly.

   2. At the beginning of the month you’ll need to record your resting
   heart rate and again at the end of the month. A low resting heart rate
   is a sign of a healthy and strong heart. It’s best to take this
   measurement first thing in the morning while you’re still in bed.

   3. Using your tracker, record how long you perform each move. Remember,
   some days are better than others. Focus on the overall trend and
   celebrate every day you get stronger. Just try to increase the duration
   by at least 15 seconds per exercise each week.

   4. Try not to take more than half the duration of the interval as
   recovery in-between exercises (i.e. you did bicycle crunches for 30
   seconds, rest for 15 seconds before moving to jump squats).

   5. Because a healthy ticker is also a happy heart, make sure you record
   at least one positive thought per day.
