11 Diet Foods That Make You Fat

   11 Diet Foods That Make You Fat

   By Lesley Rotchford

   There’s a gleaming high-rise building in Manhattan that’s home to some
   of the richest and most beautiful people in New York City. It’s also
   home to a health-food market, where you’ll often see women in the
   aisles wearing Lululemon, sampling chia-seed juice out of tiny paper
   cups, and cradling tubs of quinoa salad and bags of kale chips. Some of
   them will eventually find that, despite their irreproachable grocery
   lists, their jeans start to pinch at the waist. And they’ll be
   incredulous: But I eat organic! I’m gluten-free! I drink coconut water!

   There is a great dieting irony that’s becoming more and more apparent
   in our current health-obsessed culture: Foods that pack nutritional
   benefits may also pack on the pounds. “There’s a health halo
   surrounding this stuff, so people don’t pay attention to the
   calories—they eat and eat and think the calories will just disappear,”
   says Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition, food studies, and
   public health at New York University. These foods may also be loaded
   with sugar (green juice, for example), or carbohydrates (whole grains),
   or fat (nuts). “If you add something to your diet, even if it’s
   something healthy, you have to take something out to make up for it, or
   you’re going to gain weight,” she points out. So put down that bag of
   tamari almonds and read on.
   Hummus

   "If I open a container of hummus, I finish it," says Molly Calhoun, 36,
   a writer who is a vegetarian. "Sometimes I don’t even bother with baby
   carrots or crackers; I just eat it with a spoon like it’s yogurt."
   Hummus is so high in calories, in fact, that it’s often one of the
   first things Stephen Gullo, a New York City health psychologist,
   eliminates from his patients’ diets. "But it has protein!" they
   protest. The chickpea spread also has 70 calories in two
   tablespoons—but who stops there?—and that’s not even counting the
   vehicle you choose to dip with. "If you’re a person who, based on your
   history, can have just one or two tablespoons of hummus and leave it at
   that, then it works for you," says Gullo. "But if you know you’re going
   to eat a cup of it, you’re going to end up wearing it on your waist."
   Try one of Walden Farms’ zero-calorie vegetable dips instead.
   Grapes

   The calories here aren’t a problem, but these little pellets of
   sweetness aren’t innocuous. A cup of grapes has 15 grams of sugar. To
   put that into perspective, three Oreo cookies have 14 grams. Plus,
   “it’s hard to feel satisfied until you’ve inhaled an entire bunch of
   grapes,” says Cena Jackson, 36, a public relations director for Hermès.
   For the record, that’s around 310 calories and 75 grams of sugar. One
   way Jackson averts disaster is by freezing grapes before she snacks;
   the frozen ones take longer to chew, so she naturally eats fewer of
   them.

   Nuts

   An ounce of almonds or peanuts (that’s roughly the size of a shot
   glass) has 14 grams of fat and more than 160 calories, and if you’re
   plucking them out of a silver bowl at the bar of the Four Seasons
   Hotel, expect to blow through double that amount. “I am not an
   overeater by nature, but for some reason I have zero willpower in the
   presence of raw cashews,” says Susan Kelly, 38, a trader at a New York
   City bank. Integrative-medicine expert Frank Lipman, who is based in
   New York City, is not surprised: “Nuts tend to be a trigger food, and
   it’s very hard to practice any kind of portion control with them.”

   To get the nutritional benefits of cashews, almonds, and walnuts— such
   as vitamin E, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids—without going
   overboard, Lipman suggests sprinkling them on salads. That will limit
   how many you eat, since you aren’t likely to excuse yourself from the
   table to pour on more. You can also count out 20 nuts and hide the rest
   of the container. Gullo sequesters his beloved cashews behind a steam
   pipe on the landing of his building (next to his neighbor’s emergency
   pack of cigarettes) to avoid temptation. Registered dietitian Lauren
   Slayton, the author of The Little Book of Thin (Perigee), arms her
   clients with an Altoids-size nut case to prevent them from
   “overnutting,” as she calls it.
   Green Juice

   Juicing used to mean a bodybuilder on ‘roids. Now it more commonly
   refers to a woman with a Breville. Here’s the problem: In order to make
   healthy vegetables like spinach and Swiss chard palatable, dieters
   blend in a lot of sugary fruit. “There are six teaspoons of sugar in
   the average green juice, which is almost as much sugar as there is in a
   can of soda,” says Slayton. And those trendy juice fasts that dictate
   you consume nothing solid for days? “You miss out on protein and other
   essential nutrients and get too much sugar. Finally, you dump the fast
   and put the weight back on,” says Janis Jibrin, a nutritionist in
   Washington, D.C., and the author of The Pescetarian Plan (Ballantine
   Books).
   Dried Fruit

   Dehydrated fruit may be even worse than liquefied fruit. “I gained five
   pounds in three months after I started snacking on dried apricots,”
   says Jessica Bailey, 35, a director of Connecticut’s clean-energy
   financing authority. “I figured it’s fruit—how bad can it be?” Well,
   pretty bad. Dried fruit naturally contains a lot of sugar and calories
   (a half cup of dried apricots has about 25 grams of sugar and 107
   calories), and manufacturers often add sugar to tart fruits like
   cranberries and cherries. “It’s basically just like eating candy,” says
   Gullo. Choose fresh fruit instead, but limit especially sugary ones,
   like bananas, grapes, and mangoes.
   Coconut Water

   The refreshing juice of young coconuts is another superfood with
   weight-gain potential. Dubbed “nature’s Gatorade” by athletes, it
   contains electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, which can aid in
   exercise recovery. But a small carton has 45 calories—low by
   sports-drink standards but not insignificant—and some brands add sugar
   or fruit puree. What’s more, you don’t need extra electrolytes unless
   you are running for more than an hour, says David Nieman, a professor
   of health and exercise science at Appalachian State University in
   Boone, North Carolina. “Drink plain water,” he says.
   Agave

   Since natural-food eaters are generally horrified by the idea of
   artificial sweeteners, many choose to flavor their food and drinks with
   agave. Bad move. Made from the key ingredient in tequila, the syrupy
   sweetener has more calories than sugar—20 per teaspoon to sugar’s
   15—although it’s a bit sweeter, so you use less. While it doesn’t make
   blood sugar spike as dramatically as table sugar (which explains its
   spot on the bottom half of the glycemic index), agave can sabotage in
   other ways. It’s primarily fructose, and research has shown that too
   much of that raises the level of triglycerides linked to diabetes and
   heart disease. “Use Truvia instead, which has zero calories,” says
   Gullo.

   Gluten-Free Snacks

   Going gluten-free is what you do when you have celiac disease or, like
   millions of Americans, you are sensitive to the wheat protein found in
   baked goods, pasta, and soy sauce. Many people also avoid gluten in an
   effort to lose weight, which was a reasonable strategy until food
   companies rolled out cookies, crackers, cereals, and pizzas that are
   free of gluten yet high in sugar and fat. “When I first went
   gluten-free, I ate only whole foods, nothing processed, and lost
   weight,” says Roxanne Ierino, 28, a publicist. “Then I started eating
   gluten-free baked goods and haven’t lost a pound since.” Lipman advises
   reading the nutritional information on packaging to make sure portions
   don’t exceed 4 grams of sugar.
   Supergrains

   Quinoa, farro, and freekeh are no slouches in the nutrition department:
   Quinoa is high in protein, amino acids, fiber, and potassium; nutty
   farro has compounds that can bolster your immune system and lower
   cholesterol; and freekeh, a grain from the Middle East and the latest
   to go viral, has about four times as much fiber as brown rice. But in
   the weight-loss world, a carbohydrate is a carbohydrate, and these are
   fairly high in calories. Nicole Avena, a neuroscientist at the New York
   Obesity Research Center at Columbia University and the author of Why
   Diets Fail (Ten Speed Press), says patients can gain weight from eating
   mounds of the trendy grains. “The fiber makes you feel fuller longer,
   but like other carbohydrates, they can activate the brain’s reward
   system, which may lead some people to overconsume.” That’s a concern,
   considering a cup can have between 200 and 260 calories. The key here
   is portion control: Slayton reminds clients that a serving should be
   the size of your fist.
   Kale

   Kale is barely edible until it’s sprinkled with raisins and drizzled
   with salad dressing. (There’s a reason Caesar had to wear a toga, says
   Gullo.) “On its own, kale is extremely helpful for weight loss, but we
   don’t always eat it that way,” says Jibrin. Her favorite preparation is
   kale pureed with almond milk, potatoes, onions, and nutmeg, served as a
   satiating 48-calorie-per-cup soup.
   Raw foods

   When you eliminate cooked foods from your diet, the pickings get slim,
   but you may not. Lots of raw foods, like cabbage, carrots, and celery,
   are unimpeachable, but those on raw-food diets tend to turn to
   high-calorie nut butters, fruit purees, and dehydrated starches to form
   the basis of a filling meal. And stopping at a juice bar for a raw
   snack after Spin class can be trouble: A slice of key lime pie from one
   popular chain (made of coconut, lime, avocado, buckwheat, and sunflower
   seeds) has 880 calories, and the taco salad (with avocado, walnuts, and
   olive oil) from another chain of juice bars has 410 calories. As with
   veganism, a closely related diet, eating only fruits and vegetables has
   definite benefits. But as Mark Hyman, a prominent diet doctor in Lenox,
   Massachusetts, recently told The New York Times, ”I know a lot of fat
   vegans.”
