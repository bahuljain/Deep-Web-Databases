   I am curious about walking on my treadmill.  I just began today and
   walked for 30 minutes at about 2.5 miles per hour.  I wanted to start
   out slow so as not injure a knee that reminds me that it was injured
   long ago.  I will gradually work my speed up as I see fit.
   When I began I tested my blood glucose level and it was 225 (two hours
   after breakfast) and after a 30 minute walk it was 176.
   How much time should I wait before checking it after exercise like
   this....and how long should that lowered glucose level last?

   Congratulations on starting an exercise routine!. As you can see, the
   30 minutes of exercise certainly made a difference in your numbers!
   Everyone is different, but most times you will see a decrease in bs.
   Sometimes, you might not if you haven't had enough to eat.  Balancing
   food intake goes hand in hand with the exercise. As to the time, it
   takes me about 40 minutes to get home from the gym, and I see a
   depending on the intensity of exercise a big drop or moderate drop. How
   long should that last? Well, that depends on what you are eating too.
   But, over the long term, you will see better numbers overall with
   consistent exercise. You can't misbehave on the carbs or food and
   expect the exercise to take care of it.
   If you are 225 2 hours after breakfast, may I ask what you had for
   breakfast?
   Please check out some of Alan's or Lizzy's blogs on getting started and
   testing.
   If you are newly diagnosed with high numbers, the exercise will
   definitely make a difference in getting better control. May I suggest,
   that as you become more fit, increase the incline level. You will get a
   better workout while maintaining your speed that is comfortable for you
   with your knee. Lin

   I'd wondered the same thing -- timing of test after exercise to get a
   good idea of what's happening. I've had exercise raise my bg by at
   least 45 points, and had it lower it by 40 points. Whether I've eaten
   beforehand seems to be a factor, but it also seems time of day may
   influence it. Are there general guidelines for getting on top of the
   exercise portion of this, or is it all trial and error?

   Hi -- My main guideline has always been to just go ahead and do it.
   That's what worked for me when I started out 13 years ago, enabled me
   to normalize my original 350 blood sugar, and drop meds within the
   first 6 weeks.  Moderately brisk walking for a few minutes on the
   treadmill after most meals and occasional snacks also knocked all 40
   excess pounds of fat off me within 6 months, and normalized my weight.
   I used my next morning's fasting reading as my guide to how much to
   gradually increase exercise and decrease food amounts to achieve and
   maintain normal numbers, and rarely checked in-between.  I averaged a
   6.0 A1c for many years using that method, which I believe still works,
   although I do now sometimes check levels at other times, too.  There
   was one period where I would meticulously note my before and after
   exercise numbers, but it didn't make any overall difference other than
   telling me what I already knew: that I had to keep exercising on a
   regular basis, and that I needed a certain total amount done by the end
   of the day.  The main thing for me is just getting it done, so that's
   what I focus on -- and the overall long-term results.  For me, any
   in-between occasional checks are mainly motivational, and I don't
   get hung up on them, but they do get me going, and sometimes eating a
   little more carefully.  Checking numbers more frequently could also
   allow for more adjusting of balance between food and exercise, but
   after a while you just kind of know how much of each is required for
   optimal results, and the bg checks are usually just a confirmation of
   what you already know you need to do.  So that's why I just go ahead
   and do it.  (Or try to.)  [wink.gif]   And it works.

   I'm type 1, if that makes any difference, and my A1C averages around
   5.3.  I can pretty much count on my blood sugar going down when I
   exercise less than 90 minutes after I take a shot of Humalog.  If I'm
   exercising more than 90 minutes after I took Humalog, and my blood
   sugar is high, my blood sugar will probably increase.
   The tricky part for me is that when I exercise soon after taking
   Humalog, I can take less Humalog than I would normally take for the
   amount of food I'm eating.  But sometimes my blood sugar will go up a
   couple hours later.  I'm not sure why, but I know to be aware of the
   possibility and be ready to take more insulin.

   I haven't had too many instances of bs rising with exercise. I usually
   need to make sure that I've eaten enough to maximize the workout in
   terms of endurance and to not make bs go too low. If I'm at 60-70's,
   I'll eat too much to compensate afterwards.  As a working person, my
   workouts are after work and before dinner. I find that a plain yogurt
   with some Splenda usually does the trick. If I've had a bigger lunch,
   then no snack is needed. I combine cardio with weights and find that
   the weights will really lower the bs.
   I try to get to the gym at least 4-5 nights a week. When weather gets
   better, I'll add tennis as well and maybe some hiking on weekend.
   Hiking is a more portioned frequent snacks as I go along to keep things
   nice and even. Maybe only a 1/2 sandwich and then maybe after 2 hours
   some trail mix. Not too much food at one time. Lin
