   Nina Pham identified as Dallas nurse diagnosed with Ebola Yahoo News
   Monday, October 13, 2014
   Jason Sickles, Yahoo
   DALLAS — The Texas nurse who contracted Ebola while caring for the
   first person to die of the virus in the U.S. has been identified as
   26-year-old Nina Pham.
   Health officials have not released the nurse’s name, but Yahoo News
   identified Pham through public records and a state nursing database.
   Then on Monday, Pham’s [2]family confirmed her identity to Dallas ABC
   News affiliate WFAA.
   Pham, a critical care nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, is
   one of at least 50 to 70 people who cared for [3]Thomas Eric Duncan
   before he died last Wednesday.
   Pham has been in isolation since late Friday. The CDC confirmed her
   Ebola diagnosis on Sunday. It is the first time the deadly virus has
   been transmitted in the United States.
   The Dallas resident graduated from Texas Christian University's
   accelerated nursing program in 2010, the school said in a statement.
   State records show Pham received her nursing license in June 2010.
   The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said Pham is in stable condition
   at Texas Health Presbyterian.
   "Our team lead in Texas has spoken with her on multiple occasions,"
   Frieden said. "She's been extremely helpful."
   An unidentified person Pham had close contact with last week is also
   being monitored, but Frieden said that individual has shown no symptoms
   of Ebola.
   Investigators have not determined how Pham specifically contracted the
   disease from Duncan, who died on his 10th day of intensive care at the
   hospital.
   "If this one individual was infected and we don't know how within the
   isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have
   been infected as well," Frieden said during a press conference. "We
   consider them to be at risk, and we're doing an in-depth review and
   investigation."

   Eric Duncan]
   A day earlier, Frieden characterized the transmission from Duncan to
   Pham as a possible breach in safety protocols. On Monday he apologized
   for those remarks.
   "Some interpreted that as finding fault with the hospital or the health
   care worker, and I'm sorry if that was the impression given. That was
   certainly not my intention," Frieden said. "What we need to do, is all
   take responsibility for improving the safety of those on the front
   lines. I feel awful that a health care worker became infected in the
   care of an Ebola patient. She was there trying to help the first
   patient survive."
   Tom Ha, a longtime friend of Pham's family, told the [5]Dallas Morning
   News that it is in the nurse's genes to go out of her way to assist
   others.
   "I expect, with the big heart that she has, she went beyond what she
   was supposed to do to help anyone in need," Ha told the newspaper.
   Pham, a Fort Worth native, graduated from Nolan Catholic High School
   and still attends Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church with her family.
   Parishioners there held a prayer service for the nurse on Sunday.
   In light of what happened to Pham, Frieden said the CDC will be
   "doubling down on the amount of education, training, outreach and
   support we provide not just to this hospital but to other hospitals and
   other health care settings that are concerned appropriately about the
   possibility of detecting Ebola and safely caring for it."
   In addition to retraining in infection control, other immediate changes
   at Texas Health Presbyterian include a buddy system so Ebola caregivers
   spot one another while dressing and undressing in protective gear. The
   type and amount of protective gear is being reviewed to see if the
   removal might be too cumbersome and prone to mistakes. The number of
   health care workers treating an Ebola patient will be reduced as will
   the number of repetitive procedures, both of which might help reduce
   the risk of worker exposure. Staff will also wear respiratory
   protection in an Ebola patient's room when carrying out procedures that
   increase exposure to bodily fluids.
   "Care for a patient with Ebola requires meticulous attention to detail,
   and we're looking at every aspect to see how we can make it safer and
   easier," Frieden said.
   National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses in the
   country, plans to host a national call-in on Wednesday to discuss
   concerns about hospital readiness for Ebola. The group said more than
   80 percent of its membership surveyed report they have not been given
   adequate training on the deadly virus.
   In a statement, the Texas Nurses Association said it plans to react
   swiftly if it learns members don't have the equipment and training
   needed to protect themselves and others.
   "The facts are not known about how the nurse in Dallas was exposed,"
   wrote the Texas association. "It is incorrect to assume that the nurse
   failed to follow protocols. Just like in the case of Mr. Duncan, it is
   critical that we approach these cases objectively and learn from a full
   account of what happened."
   The hospital held a series of town hall meetings with employees on
   Monday. A minister prayed with staffers while Texas Health Resources
   CEO Barclay Berdan assured workers that the company is cooperating
   fully with the CDC.
   “We’re working closely to provide information about precautions, care
   and treatment that are consistent and understandable for patients,
   caregivers, family members and all Americans who are concerned about
   how this disease is transmitted and treated," Berdan told employees,
   according to a written statement from the hospital.
   Last month, Dallas officials were slow to decontaminate the apartment
   that Duncan had been living in. But on Monday, a hazardous materials
   team was already on its second day at Pham's apartment, located in a
   popular urban neighborhood close to restaurants and shopping.
   [6]Dallas Animal Services removed Bentley, Pham's Cavalier King Charles
   spaniel, to an undisclosed location where it will be cared for. Dallas
   County Judge Clay Jenkins told WFAA that Bentley would not be
   [7]euthanized like Excalibur, the dog belonging to a Spanish nurse with
   Ebola.
   "When I met with her parents, they said, 'This dog is important to her,
   judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog,'" Jenkins said. "If that
   dog has to be "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble," we're going to take good
   care of that dog."
