   New Emmi Program Makes Health Insurance Easy for Patients to Understand
   Marketwired Monday, November 2, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - November 02, 2015) - Four out of five
   Americans can't correctly calculate how much they owe for routine
   doctor visits under their health insurance plan, according to [3]data
   from the American Institutes for Research. Despite that, 75 percent
   believe they do know how to use health insurance, pointing to a
   knowledge gap that is especially important to address during Health
   Insurance Marketplace open enrollment beginning Nov. 1. With a newly
   released Emmi® program, healthcare organizations and providers now have
   an easier, more effective way to give their members and patients the
   information they need to make informed decisions about health plans.
   Emmi, provider of superior patient engagement solutions, has released
   its new web-based, interactive program, "[4]Health Insurance: What You
   Need to Know." The program is designed with Emmi's unique approach,
   allowing patients to more easily understand the components of their
   plan or make better informed choices about what plan is best for them,
   from both health and financial perspectives.
   Designed for multiple learning styles, the program uses plain language
   and compelling visuals to guide viewers through the basics of health
   insurance, applying Emmi's proven approach that helps empower
   individuals to take ownership of their health decisions. In addition,
   Emmi is making the program free for viewing for a limited time to
   support healthcare organizations' use for members and patients.
   Individuals can view the program on computers, tablets or smart phones
   by accessing the link below. With Health Insurance Marketplace open
   enrollment commencing, now is the time many people will be seeking more
   information about the basics of health insurance to help them make the
   right plan decisions. The open enrollment period ends Jan. 31, 2016.
   "There's no question that health insurance can be confusing," said
   Shara Cohen, Emmi's Senior Vice President of Client Experience.
   "Individuals can't be empowered to take ownership of their care if they
   don't understand the basics of how to get that care. That's why we want
   to give people the information they need in an easy-to-understand way
   so they can better navigate their decision. They will be more likely to
   use their health plan in the best way possible to improve their own
   care if they choose the plan that's right for their unique situations."
   "Choosing your health insurance can be a confusing and complex
   process," said Anne McVay, RN, quality manager at Tenet Healthcare in
   Dallas. "Emmi's video makes this process simple and easy-to-understand
   for all."
   Emmi spent the month of October spotlighting the importance of health
   literacy and how to improve patients' knowledge about healthcare on its
   [5]blog. Every individual's literacy skills, languages, age, cultural
   contexts and emotional responses can affect how a person absorbs,
   responds to and acts on health information, including insurance
   information. Emmi's human-centered design approach takes all these
   factors into account to produce programs that are simple and effective.
   Watch "[6]Health Insurance: What You Need to Know" until Nov. 30. To
