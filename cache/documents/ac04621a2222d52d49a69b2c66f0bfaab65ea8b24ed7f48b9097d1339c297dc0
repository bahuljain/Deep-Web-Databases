How Breastfeeding Could Improve Babies’ Dental Health

   breast-feeding-job

   By Tara Haelle
   HealthDay Reporter

   MONDAY, June 15, 2015 (HealthDay News) — The more babies breast-feed,
   the less likely it is that they will develop any kind of misalignment
   in their teeth later on, a new study shows.

   But pacifiers can negate some of that potential benefit, even if the
   children are breast-feeding, the Australian researchers said.

   “While most benefits of breast-feeding can be attributed to the
   breast-milk, this study highlights one of the ways that the actual act
   of breast-feeding imparts its own benefits,” said Dr. Joanna Pierro, a
   pediatric chief resident at Staten Island University Hospital in New
   York City.

   “While it is well established that exclusively breast-fed babies are at
   a decreased risk of dental malocclusion [misalignment], this study
   revealed the differences between those exclusively breast-fed versus
   those who are predominantly breast-fed,” said Pierro, who was not
   involved in the study.

   “Since many breast-fed babies today are partially fed breast-milk from
   a bottle, this research reveals how this difference affects the oral
   cavity,” she added.

   The researchers, led by Karen Peres at the University of Adelaide in
   Australia, tracked just over 1,300 children for five years, including
   how much they breast-fed at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years old. The study
   authors also asked how often the children used a pacifier, if at all,
   when the kids were 3 months, 1 year, 2 and 4. About 40 percent of the
   children used a pacifier daily for four years.

   When the children were 5, the researchers determined which of them had
   various types of misaligned teeth or jaw conditions, including open
   bite, crossbite, overbite or a moderate to severe misalignment.

   The risk of overbite was one-third lower for those who exclusively
   breast-fed for three to six months compared to those who didn’t, the
   findings showed. If they breast-fed at least six months or more, the
   risk of overbite dropped by 44 percent.

   Similarly, children who exclusively breast-fed for three months to six
   months were 41 percent less likely to have moderate to severe
   misalignment of the teeth. Breast-feeding six months or longer reduced
   their risk by 72 percent.

   The findings were published online June 15 in the journal Pediatrics.

   While the study found an association between breast-feeding and dental
   health, it did not prove a cause-and-effect link.

   But Peres offered some possible explanations for the association.

   “The plausible mechanisms which may explain the association between
   exclusive breast-feeding and lower risk of having [misaligned teeth or
   jaws] . . . include the adequate development of the orofacial
   structures in children who are breast-fed, such as proper muscular tone
   and nasal breathing,” Peres said. “In addition, children who are
   breast-fed are less likely to use a pacifier, which is considered a
   risk factor for malocclusion.”

   Pierro explained it this way.

   “Unlike feeding with a bottle, breast-feeding requires the baby to move
   her jaw and tongue in ways that help develop the oral cavity,” she
   said. “So long before baby breaks her first tooth, she is creating the
   foundation for proper alignment of the teeth.”

   The findings may also reflect the effects of a baby getting regular jaw
   exercise through the act of breast-feeding, suggested Dr. Danelle
   Fisher, vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John’s Health
   Center in Santa Monica, Calif.

   “Breast-feeding requires the use of jaw muscles more so than
   bottle-feeding, so the mechanics of breast-feeding stimulate muscle
   tone in the jaw,” Fisher said.

   Open bite, overbite and moderate to severe misalignment were generally
   less common overall among the children who mostly or exclusively
   breast-fed. Children who mostly breast-fed but also used pacifiers,
   however, were slightly more likely to have one of these misalignment
   issues, the study found.

   “Pacifiers are used for non-nutritive sucking but when overused, they
   can put pressure on the developing jaw and lead to more problems in
   older children with malocclusion [teeth/jaw misalignment],” Fisher
   said.

   That does not mean parents need to toss the pacifiers, however. The
   American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents consider using a
   pacifier for an infant’s first six months because pacifiers are
   associated with a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

   “Most infants need to suck for comfort or non-nutritive sucking,”
   Fisher said. “Pacifiers can be helpful in the newborn period and even
   help reduce incidents of SIDS in infants who sleep with them.”

   Instead, parents should simply limit pacifier use, she said. In
   addition, pacifiers are not needed past the first six to 12 months,
   Fisher said, so parents can begin weaning after that time.
