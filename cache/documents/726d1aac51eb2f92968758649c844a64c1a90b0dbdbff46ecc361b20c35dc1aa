Computer beeps with new video card?

   I installed an old GPU (I upgraded GPU's a few months ago) into a used
   HP computer I bought on ebay. The GPU is a Radeon HD 5850. I also put
   in a new 700w PSU. When I turn on the PC the screen is black. The BIOS
   beeps multiple times (didn't count sorry...i'll count tomorrow) and

   When I turn on the PC the screen is black. The BIOS beeps multiple

   My first thought was that it had to be the GPU since it hadn't been
   used for a few months and the PSU was new. I took out the GPU and
   connected the monitor to the motherboard. The computer runs fine now
   with no issues.
   So, obviously it's the GPU causing the problems. Will counting the
   beeps just tell me which part (ex. gpu, ram, etc) has the issue, which
   doesn't matter at this point since I know it's the GPU, or does the
   number of beeps also tell me specifically what's wrong with the GPU?
   Any idea why the GPU is causing problems? It fits into the pci-e slot
   perfectly. The fans on the GPU are spinning fine. The screen just stays
   black and the bios beeps multiple times when I put the GPU in there.

   Best Answer:  Haha! No. It's definitely compatible if it's PCI-Express.
   First off, you seem to have a bit of knowledge about PCs, so if this is
   all rudimentary stuff for you, I apologize. That said, it never hurts
   to check your fundamentals!
   The beeps are from the motherboard, so they won't tell you anything
   about the video card specifically. From the looks of it, it won't tell
   you anything you don't already know, but it would still be worth
   looking up just in case. Just Google your motherboard's name with "BIOS
   beep codes." This is an example:
   http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm
   Generally, a manufacturer has the same beep codes with all of their
   motherboards. Since this is an HP PC, you'll need to research that
   particular model.
   I wouldn't immediately point fingers at the video card. Issues with
   those are uncommon.
   As for your problem, I can guess a few possible scenarios:
   1. The card isn't seated completely. Don't be afraid to put some
   pressure on it. When you put the card in, look at the contacts going
   into the PCI-E slot. If you see the gold contacts at an angle, it's not
   in all the way. I've installed numerous video cards, and I've STILL
   messed this up installing into a crowded case.
   2. Possibly faulty PCI-E Slot. If the PC has two PCI-E slots, try out
   the second one. If you bought it on eBay, there's no telling. It's
   likely the seller never tested the PCI-E slots, so they could
   definitely be faulty.
   3. Did you remember to hook up external power? A 5850 probably has two
   power connectors, right?
   4. Disable onboard video. Uninstall all drivers for onboard video, boot
   into safe mode and run Driver Sweeper (Google it, great program), and
   disable onboard video in the BIOS. NOTE: Now that I've written this, I
   feel like this is the most likely scenario.
   All that said, the first thing I'd do is plug that card into a working
   PC. If you've got a PC with AMD video already, even better. Plug that
   sucker in, and see if she boots.

       If your monitor does not illuminate and the motherboard beeps, it
       means that there is a hardware problem. Count the beeps, and if
       there are pauses between them. If you have the manual, or another
       computer, look up what the number of beeps means.

       Check if the beep sequence is like this
       One long, two short beeps - if so the graphics card is faulty!
       If its anything else here is the possible beeps and their reasons
       1 short beep . Normal POST-system OK
       2 short beeps .. POST error-error code
       No beep Power supply, system board
       Continuous beep _____________ Power supply, system board
       Repeating short beeps ...... Power supply, system board
       One long, one short beep -. System board
       One long, two short beeps -.. Display adapter (MDA, CGA)
       One long, three short beeps -... Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA)
       Three long beeps - - - 3270 keyboard card
       if its the case with one long and two short beeps, may be your
       Graphics card is not compatible with your motherboard!

   I installed an old GPU (I upgraded GPU's a few months ago) into a used

   When I turn on the PC the screen is black. The BIOS beeps multiple
