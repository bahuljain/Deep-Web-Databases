       Hey you. well your parents were probably in the low fat/no fat
       generation. Didn't work. We ended up eating more carbs and sugar
       and many of us can't handle those products so we retain weight. For
       weight loss I have tried many things but by far Atkins is my
       favorite and I Love eating this way: Bacon & eggs for breakfast,
       big salad with meat, cheese, avocado and full fat dressing, for
       lunch, steak with garlic butter & a side of veggies in cheese sauce
       for dinner. Just an example. Snacks/desserts: tons ~ deviled eggs,
       salami, cheese, berries and heavy cream, leftovers, celery and bleu
       cheese or cream cheese, artichoke hearts in oil, beef jerky and
       many more. a diet of 60-70% fat is best. A very low sugar diet.
       There are many runs. sine you are 15 I would suggest you start
       backwards and eliminate foods from there.
       For a ton of recipes see linda's low carb website and definitely
       check out the wonderful success from sugar free sheila.
       And watch this video so it makes sense. It works. You'll love it.
       Get support at Atkins BB. You could easily shed at least 25 lbs by
       christmas. No exercise necessary to lose weight but I highly
       recommend for strengthening and feeling so much better! Just walk.
       You will get addicted to it.

       Cut the carbs, and really just excercise more. I lost 30 pounds in
       2 months for running 20 minutes 3 times a week.
