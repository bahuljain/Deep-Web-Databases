RESULTS FROM THE ALTITUDE TRIAL

   The addition of aliskiren, a novel direct renin inhibitor that lowers
   plasma renin activity, to standard therapy (an angiotensin-converting
   enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) did
   not improve outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes and renal
   impairment who are at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) and renal
   events. This finding is among the preliminary results of Aliskiren
   Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints [ALTITUDE;
   NCT00549757], which was stopped early in December 2011 because of
   futility and a high rate of adverse events in the aliskiren group.
   Using aliskiren with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in this population is not
   recommended and may even be harmful, said Hans-Henrik Parving, MD,
   DMSc, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, and Aarhus University,
   Aarhus, Denmark, who presented the findings.

   ALTITUDE included 8561 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment
   with standard therapy (an ACE inhibitor or ARB) plus aliskiren, 150 mg
   QD for 1 month, followed by 300 mg QD (4272 patients) or placebo (4285
   patients). All patients had type 2 diabetes, renal dysfunction, and
   were at high risk for CV disease. The trial was designed to determine
   if the addition of aliskiren would provide better cardiorenal
   protection than monotherapy.

   The primary endpoint was a composite of CV and renal outcomes,
   including CV death, resuscitated sudden death, non-fatal myocardial
   infarction, non-fatal stroke, unplanned hospitalization for heart
   failure, onset of end-stage renal disease or renal death, or doubling
   of the baseline serum creatinine level (sustained for at least 1
   month).

   At a median follow-up of 32 months, the rate of the composite endpoint
   was 17.9% in the aliskiren group and 16.8% in the placebo group (HR,
   1.08; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.20; p=0.14). Prof. Parving noted that when the
   individual components of the endpoint were analyzed separately, some
   occurred more frequently in the aliskiren group, but the differences
   were not significant (Table 1).

   Table 1. ALTITUDE HRs for Individual Components of the Primary
   Endpoint.

   CV=cardiovascular; MI=myocardial infarction; RD=renal disease.

   Hyperkalemia was the most common adverse event in the aliskiren group
   (38.7% vs 28.6%). Among the patients in that group, 8.8% had a serum
   potassium level ≥6 mmol/L, compared with 5.6% in the placebo group. The
   serum potassium level was ≥5.5 to 6.0 mmol/L in 21.0% of the aliskiren
   group and 16.0% of the placebo group. One death was associated with
   hyperkalemia. Other frequent adverse events in the aliskiren group
   included hypotension (12.1% vs 8.0%), diarrhea (9.6% vs 7.2%), and
   falls (2.8% vs 2.6%).

   In discussing the study, Johannes Mann, MD, Friedrich Alexander
   University, Erlangen, Germany, and McMaster University, Hamilton,
   Ontario, Canada, noted that the reason for a possible increased risk of
   stroke was unclear. Dual inhibition of the renin system was not
   associated with such an increased risk in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone
   and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial [ONTARGET], in
   which the combination of ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) and telmisartan
   (an ARB) was compared with each drug used as monotherapy [Tobe SW et
   al. Circulation 2011]. Both Prof. Mann and Prof. Parving said that the
   observed risk could be a direct effect of aliskiren or could be a
   chance finding.


RESULTS FROM THE PURE STUDY

   Results from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology [PURE] study,
   presented by Salim Yusuf, MD, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,
   Canada, indicated that different strategies are needed to influence
   health behaviors in countries, depending upon their socioeconomic
   status. In relatively low-income countries, key strategies include
   making healthy foods accessible and affordable, and promoting smoking
   cessation. Among relatively more high-income/industrialized countries,
   efforts should be focused on increasing physical activity and
   decreasing fat consumption, while continuing to promote smoking
   cessation.


   Diet, physical activity, and smoking account for 50% to 60% of the risk
   for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [Yusuf S et al. Lancet 2004; Tu JV.
   Lancet 2010]; however, these factors vary markedly both across and
   within countries, due to environmental and societal factors. The PURE
   study was designed to create an understanding of these factors in order
   to develop contextually appropriate strategies for CVD prevention.


   The PURE study was comprised of 153,996 individuals (aged 35 to 70
   years; 42.1% men) from 348 urban and 280 rural communities in 17 low-,
   middle-, and high-income countries for whom data on diet, physical
   activity, and smoking were collected during 2003-2010. Validated food
   frequency questionnaires were used to record diet; physical activity
   (recreational and nonrecreational/obligatory) was collected using the
   International Physical Activity Questionnaire. These factors, plus
   smoking prevalence (ever, current, and quitting) were then related to
   country gross domestic product (GDP; World Bank statistics) and
   household wealth (wealth index) overall and separately for individuals
   from urban and rural areas.


   Results from the PURE study showed that among those living in
   low-income countries there is less consumption of fruits, vegetables,
   proteins and fats, and a higher consumption of carbohydrates, which
   researchers attributed to the affordability of different foods.
   Activity levels were higher in low-income countries due to a higher
   level of obligatory physical activities (mostly work and
   transportation-related). Smoking was also more prevalent among
   individuals in low-income countries. As country GDP increased, there
   was an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, accompanied by a
   higher percentage of energy obtained from total (but not saturated)
   fats and proteins, with a lower percentage of energy from
   carbohydrates. Physical activity declined with increasing GDP mostly
   because of a marked decline in obligatory/nonrecreational activity that
   was not compensated for by an increase in recreational physical
   activity. In all categories studied, the association of household
   wealth to diet, physical activity, and quitting smoking were similar to
   that observed for GDP.


   "Policies to prevent CVD need to focus on different aspects of
   lifestyle among the rich versus the poor and between rich and poor
   countries,” said Prof. Yusuf. "In particular, healthy foods need to
   become more affordable.”



CLARIFY: SIMILAR 1-YEAR OUTCOMES FOR MEN AND WOMEN WITH STABLE CAD

   Despite substantial differences in the risk profiles of men and women
   with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), outcomes at 1 year appear to
   be similar, according to an analysis of data from the international
   Prospective Observational Longitudinal Registry of Patients with Stable
   Coronary Artery Disease [CLARIFY; Steg PG et al. Eur Heart J 2012]
   registry. The study adds new insights into gender differences in stable
   CAD, as relatively few studies have compared outcomes in this patient
   population. However, results should be interpreted in the context of an
   observational registry data set.
   The study included data for 30,977 outpatients with stable CAD, defined
   as prior myocardial infarction (MI), angiographic coronary disease
   (>50% lesion), ischemic symptoms and a positive stress test, or prior
   coronary revascularization from 45 countries; 23,975 (77.4%) of the
   patients were men. The main outcome was a composite of cardiovascular
   (CV) death, MI, or stroke. Analyses were time to first event, and
   comparisons by gender were adjusted for differences in patient baseline
   characteristics.

   At 1 year, the rate of the primary outcome was similar for men and
   women (adjusted rates, 1.7% vs 1.8%, respectively; OR, 0.93; 95% CI,
   0.75 to 1.15; p=0.5), reported Philippe Gabriel Steg, MD, Hôpital
   Bichat, Paris, France, who presented the findings of the study. Women
   were at similar risk as men for major CV outcomes (Figure 1). Prof.
   Steg added that there was an interaction between gender and age, with
   younger women having slightly better outcomes than younger men;
   however, the same was not true for middle-aged or older women
   (p-interaction=0.0077).
   The risk profile differed substantially by gender, with women more
   likely to have hypertension or diabetes (Table 1). Women were also more
   likely to have angina but were less likely to have had diagnostic
   non-invasive testing or coronary angiography, to have received
   evidence-based pharmacologic treatments, or to have had
   revascularization (Table 1).

   Prof. Steg noted several limitations to the study. The primary
   limitation was the relatively low number of women, which he noted may
   have been related to the inclusion criteria required by the study. In
   addition, the cohort sample may not be representative of a
   population-based sample, as physician and patient participation in the
   CLARIFY registry is voluntary. Also, despite adjustments for potential
   confounders, residual confounding cannot be excluded.


HPS2-THRIVE RESULTS

   Approximately two thirds of patients can tolerate extended-release (ER)
   niacin when combined with laropiprant, according to a prespecified
   interim safety and tolerability analysis of the Heart Protection Study
   2: Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events
   [HPS2-THRIVE; NCT00461630] study. The addition of niacin/laropiprant to
   statin therapy offers a dual goal of decreasing low-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and increasing high-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C).

   Niacin, the first lipid-modifying drug, is one of the most effective
   agents for increasing HDL-C levels. However, its use has been limited
   by its side effects, particularly flushing. Coadministration of
   laropiprant, a selective prostaglandin D antagonist, has been shown to
   reduce flushing. However, the drug may not reduce this side effect in
   all patients, as flushing can occur through other pathways.

   HPS2-THRIVE includes more than 25,000 patients in Europe and China who
   have cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are at high risk for recurrent
   vascular events. The patients were randomly assigned to ER niacin 2
   g/laropiprant or to placebo. All patients also received LDL-C reducing
   therapy with simvastatin 40 mg, with or without ezetimibe 10 mg. The
   study is the largest one to date to evaluate the CV benefits of
   increasing HDL-C levels. Jane Armitage, MD, Oxford Clinical Trial
   Service, Oxford, United Kingdom, reported on the safety and
   tolerability of the combination drug.

   Patients were treated with ER niacin/laropiprant or placebo during an
   8-week run-in phase prior to randomization. During this phase, 25.4% of
   patients in the ER niacin/laropiprant group withdrew from therapy for
   any medical reason; the primary reasons were cutaneous effects
   (primarily flushing, 11.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (5.5%). An
   additional 8.7% of patients in this group withdrew during the
   randomized treatment phase, again primarily because of cutaneous
   effects (5.1%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (3.6%). Among patients in
   the placebo group, 1.2% withdrew during the treatment phase because of
   cutaneous effects and 1.6% because of gastrointestinal symptoms.

   Prof. Armitage noted that ER niacin/laropiprant was associated with a
   high rate of myopathy (1.13% vs 0.18% in the placebo group). This
   finding was seen primarily in patients of Chinese descent (62 of 69
   patients with myopathy were from China). Overall, rhabdomyolysis was
   rare (0.05% in the treatment group and 0.02% in the placebo group). The
   identification of an increased risk of myopathy with niacin and
   simvastatin prompted the following change to the simvastatin label:
   "Patients of Chinese descent should not receive simvastatin 80 mg with
   cholesterol-modifying doses of niacin-containing products.”

   Prof. Armitage reported that during the run-in phase, LDL-C levels were
   reduced by 20% and HDL-C levels were increased by 17%. These results
   differ from those in the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic
   Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health
   Outcomes [AIM-HIGH] trial, in which LDL-C levels were reduced 5.5% and
   HDL-C levels were increased by 13.2% [AIM-HIGH Investigators. N Engl J
   Med 2011]. The AIM-HIGH trial was stopped early because of a lack of
   benefit of niacin. Whether the more favorable effects on LDL-C lowering
   and HDL-C raising in HPS2-THRIVE and better tolerability of niacin when
   combined with laropiprant will translate into a reduction in vascular
   events will have to wait until the presentation of the study's primary
   efficacy results in 2013.

PROFESS STUDY RESULTS

   A landmark analysis is providing insight into the relationship between
   resting heart rate and outcomes after ischemic stroke. An analysis of
   data from the 20,165 patients enrolled in the Prevention Regimen for
   Effectively Avoiding Second Stroke [PRoFESS] study showed that heart
   rate is associated with mortality among patients with stroke and that a
   low heart rate is associated with a better functional outcome and less
   cognitive decline after an ischemic stroke.

   PRoFESS was a 2x2 factorial trial that evaluated the safety and
   efficacy of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole compared with
   clopidogrel (as noninferiority first then superiority), and the safety
   and efficacy of telmisartan compared with placebo (superiority) [Diener
   HC et al. Cerebrovasc Dis 2007]. The primary results of both
   comparisons have been previously published [Yusuf et al. N Engl J Med
   2008; Sacco et al. N Engl J Med 2008].

   Prior studies have shown an association between resting heart rate and
   cardiovascular (CV) events along the CV continuum, and stress models
   have shown that reducing heart rate may reduce the size of a stroke,
   explained Michael Böhm, MD, Universitätskliniken des Saarlandes, Klinik
   für Innere Medizin III, Homburg/Saar, Germany, who presented the
   findings of the study. Thus, the current study was designed to answer
   the questions of whether baseline heart rate predicts recurrent stroke,
   myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, or death after stroke or is
   associated with functional outcome or cognitive decline after recurrent
   stroke [Böhm M et al. Eur Heart J 2012].

   The patients were grouped according to baseline heart rates, with
   quintiles of ≤64, 65 to 70, 71 to 76, 77 to 82, and >82 beats per
   minute (bpm). The predefined endpoints were disability after a
   recurrent stroke, as assessed with the modified Rankin Scale score and
   the Barthel Index, and cognitive function, as assessed with the
   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Disability was assessed at
   3 weeks, and the MMSE score was determined at 4 weeks after
   randomization and at the penultimate visit.

   Overall, increasing quartile of heart rate was associated with female
   gender and diabetes mellitus. b-blocker use, statin use, hypertension,
   and age were associated with lower heart rates.

   All-cause mortality was higher among patients in the 3 highest
   quintiles of heart rate compared with the lowest quintile (71 to 76
   bpm: HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.56; 77 to 82 bpm; HR, 1.42; 95% CI,
   1.19 to 1.69; and >82 bpm: HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.06; p<0.0001 for
   both). Prof. Böhm noted that the heart rate threshold differed for CV
   and non-CV mortality (Figure 1). Baseline heart rate was not associated
   with MI, recurrent stroke, or new or worsening heart failure.

   Resting Heart Rate.

   Among 1627 patients who had a recurrent stroke, the functional outcome
   at 3 months was better in patients with a lower heart rate at baseline.
   The baseline heart rate was also significantly associated with
   cognitive decline according to the MMSE score (≤24 points; p=0.0001;
   Figure 2); more patients with a heart rate >82 bpm had a decrease of 2
   points on the MMSE between the 1 month and penultimate visits.

   Prof. Böhm interpreted these findings as suggestive that lower heart
   rates may be associated with smaller strokes rather than fewer
   recurrent strokes. Further study will be needed to better understand
   whether heart rate plays a causative role in outcomes after stroke and
   whether therapies to reduce heart rate will be beneficial in patients
   experiencing a first stroke.

OUTCOMES FROM THE CARDIA TRIAL

   No clear evidence supports routine percutaneous coronary intervention
   (PCI) for patients with diabetes and multivessel disease, according to
   5-year follow-up data from the Coronary Artery Revascularisation in
   Diabetes [CARDia; ISRCTN19872154] trial. Coronary artery bypass graft
   (CABG) surgery is favored, unless clinical features indicate that PCI
   is clearly preferable.

   The CARDia trial was designed in the early 2000s as the first
   randomized comparison of PCI and CABG for patients with diabetes and
   multivessel (or complex disease of the left anterior descending)
   coronary artery disease [Kapur A et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2010]. A
   total of 510 patients were randomized to CABG (n=254) or to PCI plus
   stenting and routine abciximab (n=256). The primary endpoint was a
   composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and
   stroke; the main secondary outcome included the addition of repeat
   revascularization to the primary outcome events. According to
   noninferiority analysis, PCI proved not to be noninferior to CABG at 1
   year of follow-up (13.0% in the PCI group vs 10.5% in the CABG group;
   HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.75 to 2.09; p=0.39). The rates of all-cause
   mortality were similar for the 2 groups (3.2%).

   Roger Hall, MD, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA, reported
   the most recent findings of the trial. At a median of 5.1 years of
   follow-up, conventional intention-to-treat analysis did not show a
   significant difference in the primary endpoint for the 2 groups (26.6%
   in the PCI group vs 20.5% in the CABG group; HR,1.34; 95% CI, 0.94 to
   1.93), but Dr. Hall said the study was underpowered for this
   comparison. PCI was associated with significantly higher rates of
   repeat revascularization (21.9% vs 8.3%; p<0.001), nonfatal MI (14% vs
   6.3%; p=0.007), and a composite of death, MI, stroke, or repeat
   revascularization (37.5% vs 26%; p=0.005). There was no difference in
   nonfatal stroke (p=0.48). The similar all-cause mortality rates at 1
   year continued at 5 years (14% in the PCI group and 12.6% in the CABG
   group; p=0.53; Table 1).
   Table 1. Comparison of CABG and PCI at 5 Years of Follow-Up.


   *Composite of death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke; CABG=coronary
   artery bypass graft; MI=myocardial infarction; PCI=percutaneous
   coronary intervention.

   Dr. Hall noted that the findings did not confirm the results of other
   studies showing much higher mortality at 5 years in association with
   PCI, and thus, PCI may be an option in carefully selected patients with
   diabetes and multivessel disease as an alternative to CABG, although
   the latter remains the preferred method of revascularization for the
   majority of these patients.
