   It does get easier.  Our son was diagnosed three days before Christmas
   in 2010.  We went through and are still going through all of those same
   feelings...guilt, fear, anger, etc.  But as time goes on, things seem
   to become a bit more normal.  Our son is 16 where yours is only 4, but
   I have spoken with parents of younger kids in your situation and they
   say that it does get more manageable.  Stay in close touch with your
   Doctor and his team...they will make sure you are giving the correct
   amount of insulin.  God bless you and your children.

   I am so sorry about your son's diagnosis.  You are not alone and all
   your feelings are normal.  It has been almost 3 years for us and our
   son will soon be 16.  I still cry every so often but most of the time
   he does very well.  You may want to reach out to JDRF and see if they
   can put you in touch with a local family.  We will all help you as much
   as we can.  Also, there is nothing you did or could have done
   differently that caused this.  Take care and let us know how you are.

   My daughter was also diagnosed now almost two years ago. She is now 6.
   We were lost as well. I know exactly how you are feeling and I felt the
   same way. My daughter was in daycare and there was no one willing to
   help us. I felt isolated. I know that all of the quesions can seem
   overwhelming when you don't feel as if you have answers. Just remember
   that you are a good mom and you can handle this. Just remember that
   your child will look to you as to how to deal with this. They are going
   through all the same things as you are and I found it good to tell my
   daughter that this stinks but we will handle it together and explain as
   much as I thought was good for her to know. She now has a pump and can
   do it all by herself. She knows when her sugar is high and will turn to
   me when she is having a low and tell me. She is still 6 and has her
   moments but her disease is only a small part of her. YOU CAN DO
   THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Hi Jloo,
   God Bless you and your family.
   Katie was diagnosed at 7, between 1st and second grade.  We will be 3
   years with D this July.
   When first diagnosed, many kids (and adults) undergo a "honeymoon"
   period.  This is a breif period where the pancreas, getting some relief
   from injected insulin, recovers some function.  I don't recall the
   exact numbers anymore, but we ended up using about 1/4th the insulin
   for a short time.  I thought it was the beginning of a miracle cure,
   alas it was just the normal progress.  We were diagnosed in July, her
   insulin needs troughed in Oct / Nov and by the end of the school year
   we were using more than was needed initially.
   Where is your location?  Hopefully somewhere with a good pediatric endo
   program.  We are lucky enough to be in the Houston area and go to the
   Texas Childrens.
   You usually start on a fixed dose of insulin with a prescribed number
   of carbs.  Over time, you should get trained on matching the insulin to
   the carbs you want to give.  Then you can have low or high carb meals
   at will.
   While on the fixed dose program, make sure you call the doc / nurse is
   you have 2 or the 3 low episodes.  This could indicate the beginning of
   the honeymoon and they will need to adjust the dose downward.
   I remember that when they sent Katie home, they prescribed a 75 g Carb
   meal, breakfast lunch and dinner, with 30 gram carb snack twice a day.
   It was more than she would eat, but the doctor insisted.  We ended up
   with tons of lows when she got full and wouldn't eat any more.
   Our solution was to report the low, but stay quite about the unfinished
   meal (they rejected that notion out right) and so over a period of 3 or
   4 weeks we got the doses in line with what she would eat.  Just letting
   you know there are many ways to skin the cat.
   I have lots of tips for those just learning, but the best one for a kid
   going to school is to pack their lunch for them.  It's the only way to
   make sure you actually know the carb count.
   My second best tip is about correcting lows.  We were sent home with
   instruction to give 15 grams for a low.  Katie would go from low (~40)
   to screaming high (~300) and end up with a headache.  Turns out carb
   sensitivity scales with body weight, so a 50 lb kids blood sugar goes
   up 3 times as much as a 150 lb adult for the same carbs.  We use the
   following to correct lows:
   Gummy life savers - 3 grams
   Starburst - 4 grams
   Smarties - 6 grams / roll (these are the litte sweet tart candies and
   are our favorite, they are 15 disks to a roll, so you can "dial a dose"
   giving 5 disks for 2 grams, etc - they are also the fasted acting of
   the sugar snacks, and they last in a fanny pack).
   Best of luck and God Bless,
   KatiesDad

   My daughter just started kindergarten this year. Although they have a
   few children with this disease every child is different. The first few
   weeks were crazy her sugar was up and down. I was on the phone with my
   endo. atleast 3 or 4 times in the first week of school. Remember that
   what they are doing during the day may affect them as well as their
   emotions. After about two weeks my daughters sugar has evened out but
   those first two weeks were a horror. Even the nurse didn't know what to
   do. (she had a low once and the woman gave her 58 crabs because she
   freaked out I thought I was going to scream) I had to stay with my
   daughter at daycare after her initial diagnosis. I did her sugar and
   her shots out in front of all the teachers and children. It helped them
   to understand too. They all need to understand what is going on. If
   something happened to her when a teacher wasn't watching they would
   know that she is sick and that they need to tell someone. By the time
   she went to kindergarten it was just another thing happening in the
   classroom and no one even paid attention. Keep your eye on the lows and
   make sure of why he may be having them. They may need to make
   adjustments in his carb ratios on certain days if he is more active he
   may need less. My endo says that sometimes there is no telling what
   will affect them and you just have to be able to adjust with it.
   Someone gave me this book that really helped me. They said they got it
   on Amazon the name was my four year old has diabetes. I know that it
   helped me not feel so alone. Also there was this Poem Welcome to
   Holland about having a child with special needs. It really does hit on
   what we are feeling. I hope things go better in the future. The only
   thing that we can do is adjust the best we can and remember that you
   can handle this.

   You mentioned the 'Holland' story so I had to search through what I've
   saved and put it here.  [wink.gif]
   c1987 by Emily Perl Kingsley. All rights reserved
   I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a
   disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique
   experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like
   this......
   When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous
   vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your
   wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in
   Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very
   exciting.
   After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack
   your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The
   stewardess comes in and says, "Welcome to Holland."
   "Holland?!?" you say. "What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for
   Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going
   to Italy."
   But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland
   and there you must stay.
   The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible,
   disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's
   just a different place.
   So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole
   new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would
   never have met.
   It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy
   than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your
   breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has
   windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.
   But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and
   they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And
   for the rest of your life, you will say "Yes, that's where I was
   supposed to go. That's what I had planned."
   And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because
   the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.
   But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to
   Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely
   things ... about Holland.
