   Pet Therapy: Some Hospitals Allow Patients' Own Dogs to Visit Good
   Morning America Thursday, June 21, 2012
   DR. SHEILA REDDY, ABC News Medical Unit
   Madison Fleaks had been in Texas Children's Hospital in Houston for
   over six months waiting for a heart transplant. She was born with a
   congenital heart condition.
   Not yet two years old, she may have forgotten much of her life at home.
   But she still remembered her two dogs; their photograph sat framed next
   to her hospital bed.
   "If you said anything about the dogs, she would point and want to kiss
   the picture," said her mother, Tabitha Fleaks. Madison has been in and
   out of hospitals, she said, enduring multiple surgeries.
   "She has been sick her whole life. All she knows is me, her dad, and
   the two dogs."
   So when her dog Kodiak showed up in her hospital room one day, Madison
   was thrilled.
   "It was amazing," Fleaks said. "She just lit up. She literally screamed
   when he walked into the door."
   Texas Children's is not the only institution to allow some patients to
   have [2]visitors of the canine variety. ABC News reached out to
   hospitals around the country and found that many have [3]pet therapy
   programs, in which a trained owner-volunteer will bring a dog to the
   hospital for patients to enjoy. These programs have been said to help
   patients with their mood, pain, and comfort levels.
   A growing number of these hospitals have taken their pet therapy
   programs even farther, allowing patients to have visits from their own
   pets.
   "When there is a patient in the hospital that will be here for a
   significant amount of time, we think it is important for them to have
   their entire family here," said Jamie Snow, Assistant Director of Child
   Life and Social Work at Texas Children's Hospital. "And some people
   consider their pets family members."
   The program started at Texas Children's four years ago, when
   administrators were approached by an organization called PAWS (Pets Are
   Wonderful Support) Houston, a non-profit organization the helps to
   sustain the relationships between pet owners and their pets during a
   prolonged hospitalization.
   Here's how it works: a social worker or child life specialist, hearing
   that a patient has a pet at home, speaks to doctors who can approve a
   visit. Then PAWS is contacted. They ensure that the pet is vaccinated
   and has a bath before the visit. A PAWS volunteer will meet the pet and
   family members at the entrance of the hospital where they perform a
   "behavior check" to make sure the pet's temperament is good for a
   hospital environment. They then take the pet to the patient's room.
   "We have never had any bad events from an animal visit," said Tricia
   Lewis, a nursing director at the Methodist Hospital System in Houston,
   Texas, who worked with PAWS to pioneer the personal pet visitation
   policy at her hospital over a decade ago. "No bites, no infections."
   Dog Visits Safe if Precautions Taken
   Dr. Loreen Herwaldt, a professor of medicine at the University of Iowa
   Colleges of Medicine and Public Health, and Jean Pottinger, an
   infection prevention expert for University of Iowa Healthcare, helped
   bring the personal pet policy to their hospitals. Pottinger, too, said
   there have never been any infections that were attributable to animals
   at her hospital. And she said there has been no documentation of any
   bad outcomes from pet visits in her hospital.
   Herwaldt said there is likely good reason for the lack of infections
   from the animals. "[The patients] were living in very close contact
   with these animals before they came in and have been exposed to the
   organisms the animal is carrying," she said. "They will be going back
   to that environment as well. We make sure [the patients] wash their
   hands before and after the visit."
   Hospitals take other precautions to reduce any risk of infection.
   Barriers are placed between animals and bedsheets, and the sheets are
   changed after the animal leaves.
   The experience has been positive for patients, said Donna Dishman,
   co-founder and executive director of PAWS Houston. She said the first
   personal pet visit was remarkable. The patient was an 83-year-old woman
   in intensive care, diagnosed with breast cancer.
   "[She] was not eating, not responding, and had given up," Dishman said.
   "When we put her dog on her bed, she started talking, and started
   eating."
   "Often there are people who are not doing well, and don't respond to
   staff and people but for some reason make an effort to speak when
   animals come around," said Dr. Lisa Portnoy, a veterinarian and animal
   program director for the NIH Clinical Center.
   Such programs may become even more common as hospitals strive to find
   special ways to meet the needs of patients and their families.
   "I think that when we think about a patient-centered environment, we
   have to think about what is meaningful to health and well-being to the
   patient," said Linda Laskowski Jones, Christiana Care Health System's
   Vice President of Emergency and Trauma Services in Delaware, where a
   personal pet visitation policy is also in place. "The framework has to
   include animals. That is important to health and recovery and comfort."
   For Tabitha Fleaks, having their family dog visit was comforting to her
   as well as to her daughter.
   "I'm here every single day [with my daughter] and my dogs are a part of
   our family," she said. "It made my day to see our dog because I'm so
   used to seeing them all day long in my house and it made it feel more
   like home."
   Madison, who had a heart transplant a few weeks ago, will be discharged
   from the hospital this week.
   "Every day when you say, 'Where is Kodiak? Where did he go? Where is
   he?' she points to the door. It was the biggest blessing for her to see
   him," Fleaks said.
