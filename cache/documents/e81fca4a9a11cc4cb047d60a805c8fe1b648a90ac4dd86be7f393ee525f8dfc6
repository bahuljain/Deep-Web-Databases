Cocktail Confidential: How Many Calories are Really in Your Favorite Drinks?

Liquor labels are a mishmash of confusing regulations and information. Wine
and hard liquors list alcohol content, but it is not mandatory for beer. And
while “light” beer and low-alcohol wines list calories, regular beer, wine,
and hard liquors generally don’t. What’s a calorie-minded consumer to do?
Here’s your guide to cocktail calories.

   From [92]Health magazine
   For now, the Feds will keep you guessing how many calories are in your
   favorite drink. But we won't.
   And that's something the National Consumers League (NCL) and the Center
   for Science in the Public Interest aim to change.
   They, along with 67 other consumer groups, are urging the government to
   require labels that list not just calories and alcohol content, but
   also how many servings each container has and what its ingredients are.
   That way, people can steer clear of allergens like the nuts and dairy
   that are often found in cocktail mixes.
   Right now, liquor labels are a mishmash of confusing regulations and
   information, explains Linda Golodner, president of NCL. Wine and hard
   liquors list alcohol content, but it is not mandatory for beer. And
   while "light" beer and low-alcohol wines list calories, regular beer,
   wine, and hard liquors generally don't. Golodner argues that consumers
   need basic label information to make smart choices about what they
   drink, just as they do about the food they eat.
   Liquor lowdown
   Some beverage companies are already listing details voluntarily. That's
   particularly true of distilled-spirits makers, who are happy to point
   out that their products have fewer carbs or calories. "We're adamant
   about the need for putting alcohol content on labels," says Monica
   Gourovitch, PhD, senior vice president of scientific affairs at the
   Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group that
   includes producers of rum, vodka, and other spirits. But Gourovitch
   says her group wants listing nutrients and ingredients to be done on a
   voluntary basis, and left up to the individual producers.
   Until the Feds sort out what to make mandatory on labels for your
   favorite microbrew or sauvignon blanc, here's our cheat sheet to help
   you figure out whether to order that second round of mojitos. After
   all, you do want to fit into that cocktail dress.
   How many calories are in that drink? Here's our happy-hour cheat sheet:


                                               Calories Carbs Fat Sip Tip:
        Red wine (5 oz.) 102 22 g 0 g Rich in antioxidant compounds called
           polyphenols, which may lessen risk for cancer and heart disease
        White wine (5 oz.) 96 1 g 0 g Has fewer polyphenols than red wine,
      because antioxidant-rich grape skins are removed to keep color white
      Regular beer (12 oz.) 146 13 g 0 g Has twice as many antioxidants as
                             white wine and about half as many as red wine
      Light beer (12 oz.) 99 5 g 0 g Has fewer antioxidants than dark beer
    Margarita (3 oz.) 157 9 g 0 g Has small amount of lime juice, which is
                                                         rich in vitamin C
      Mojito (7 oz.) 172 11 g 0 g Has small amount of lime juice and fresh
                                       mint, which is rich in antioxidants
      Cosmopolitan (6 oz.) 143 13 g 0 g Has some cranberry juice, which is
    rich in antioxidants and proanthocyanidins, compounds that may inhibit
                                                infection-causing bacteria
           Gin & tonic (7 oz.) 179 12 g 0 g Tonic water has sugar; save 50
                                                  calories with diet tonic
    Piña colada (5 oz.) 245 32 g 3 g Extra calories come from the coconut
                                                 cream and pineapple juice

   Note: A standard drink serving is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine,
   and 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.
