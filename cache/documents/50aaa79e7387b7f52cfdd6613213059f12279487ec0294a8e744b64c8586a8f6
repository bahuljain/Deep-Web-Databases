   Pam,


   That NBA arguement is weak at best. Chris Paul, Spud Webb, Mugsey
   Boges, all were way shorter than the average height in the NBA. The
   reason these players were able to play in the NBA is because they had
   the skill to do so.


   I have the skills and abilities to serve my country no matter what if I
   am a diabetic or if i were short. And the little statement about making
   your child feel normal by not referring to others as normal is stupid
   as well. The government (in way of policies and discrimination) are the
   ones that determine who is normal and who is not. We see it all the
   time. Blaming a parent is even weaker than the NBA arguement.

   Actually, since effective treatment of diabetes did not exist at the
   time of the revolutionary war, this argument is not valid, diabetes was
   a death sentence back then.

   This seems to be a source of debate, I for one can see both sides of
   the argument. I spent eight years active duty and it was one of the
   best decisions I ever made, absolutely loved it. But I honesty have to
   say, there is no way I could have been a effective as I was if I was
   diabetic when I joined, had they allowed it.
   As far as allowing someone to stay after diagnosis, they only do so if
   you can demonstrate you can, and to the best of my knowledge, it is
   only if you have been in for over ten years. And then you will be
   medically retired at the twenty year mark.
   The Sargent that served in Iraq was a one time exception, but very well
   may be the beginning of the next chapter, so by all means, keep up the
   fight.
   He was in year fourteen when diagnosed, and if we keep watching his
   career, I bet he retires at twenty.

   That is my point. No effective treatment for the men who fought in the
   Revolutionary War, but they fought anyway. Many volunteered. Those were
   the days of true freedom. This arguement is very valid. I, like my
   forefathers, would like to excercise my right to decide what i do with
   my life. There are many jobs in the military that do not put folks in
   harms way. So the arguement that all diabetics should be banned from
   service is a lame excuse. I was diagnosed in June of 1999, after being
   a diabetic since at least the end of Jan 99. I went 5-6 months with no
   insulin. I lost 40 lbs and argued with my doctor on being admitted to
   the hospital. She wanted me to stay for 3 days. I gave her 1 night and
   1 day. i know myself better than those who don't even have the disease.
   I know what I can and cannot do, not some desk jockey in D.C. making
   decisions on what could maybe happen. I know if i can perform the
   duties described. No one else can ever tell me what i am capable of.

   It is ironic. During the revolutionary war anyone and everyone could
   join up. Now days, we have advanced medical treatments for practically
   everything and my freedom has been taken away. If there was ever a time
   for a diabetic to serve and live a long life it is now. It makes no
   logical sense, which goes against everything the military organized
   around (logic). Oh well. I will either win the legal battle, or be
   cured within 3 years and then sign up for the Army. If not, then it
   looks like I may be serving in the military of another country. i am a
   warrior at heart and mind and will die for those who are loyal to their
   people and loyal to freedom.

   most of the people with T1 in the revolutionary war would have died
   before they got to fighting age.  While I know (first hand) that adults
   can get T1, it is still less of a percentage than juvenile.. and
   without statistics to back me,I believe it has increased over the
   years.

   To everyone who has so far posted.   Every person  has a right to their
   own opinions.

   Hopefully based on facts.  I respond again after reading more
   posts.......


   This quote is from a retired Battle Commander, USAF.  "The biggest
   barrier to diabetics serving in the military is predictability!  Fellow
   comrades must be able to absolutely depend upon the  immediate response
   from their comrades at all times.  Everyone's life depends on it!.
   Even the loved ones back home"


   There are positions within the military complex that persons with
   diabetes, wanting to serve, may be able to qualify to hold.   At the
   same time, when a crises occurs everyone must respond.


   An example: The Cuban [edited] Missle crises; too close to home! (Oops
   made that mistake, sorry.)  The military personnel knew what to do and
   acted immediately (no time  to test their BG).  Fighters were instantly
   in the air, ground troops armed and ready, their families if with
   them,  had been taught how to handle a crises.  I was there, I know
   what I saw and experienced!

   The original poster edited out their comment about "normal" people vs.

   ummmmm insulin wasn't discovered until 1922.... which would be after
   ww1......  sooo yeah pretty much i can guarentee they weren't shooting
   muskets..... once dx'd you were withering away to nothing from the
   "pissing evile"...

   i understand your gunghoenessbut you have to worry about more than your
   ship sinking though.....


   like oops i just dropped my last months supply of insulin and the vial
   shattered on the floor...... it isn't like you can say 'hey cap'n turn
   this burg round'.......


   also while in intense situations like say running into pirates as an
   officer you are responsible for others... stress and thinking cause
   your brain to exercise and can cause a hypo which affects the
   decisions  you make for your men..... again it is more than you saying
   i got this.....

   and also please undetsand no one is taking away your 'freedoms'.... it
   isn't mandatory you serve that being said since it is not mandatory you
   cannot also mandate the rules for which they accept volunteers.... it
   is of the volunteer military to decide what type of volunteers they
   will accept.....


   they say no to type1 i accept it and agree with it...  that being said
   that doesn't stop you from having the freedom to choose to apply for
   another job elsewhere.. and also in doing soo those companies or
   organization can elect to choose whom they want to deal with....


   our "freedom" is the freedom to choose but that being said it leaves
   the other party up to choose as well and when both can come to a mutual
   agreement they do, when they cannot they don't....   but that is your
   freedom.... that is what my military has fought for....


   you have to understand the freedom to choose cuts both ways....
