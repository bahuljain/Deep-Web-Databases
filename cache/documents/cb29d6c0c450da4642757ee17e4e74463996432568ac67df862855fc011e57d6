What This Mom With Terminal Cancer Is Leaving Behind for Her Daughter Will
Melt Your Heart

   July 27, 2015 | By Lindsey Murray

   Like every mom, Heather McManamy wants to be a part of the most
   important moments in her 4-year old daughter’s life. Her wedding day,
   the day she gets her driver’s license, her first broken heart—and
   McManamy is not going to let her battle with breast cancer stop her
   from being involved in her daughter’s future milestones.

   The 35-year-old mother from McFarland, Wis., was diagnosed with stage 2
   breast cancer in April 2013, but the news took a turn for the worse
   when doctors told her cancer was terminal just a little over a year
   later.

   “Once you’re [98]stage four there is no cure,” she explained to her
   local NBC station in Madison. “The list I have of treatments to try is
   dwindling.”

   While she has pledged to do “anything and everything” she can to beat
   the disease, McManamy wants to make sure no matter what happens that at
   least a small part of her will be there for her daughter, Brianna,
   during the important milestones of her life.

   For the past few months, McManamy has written over 40 greeting cards
   that offer advice, share jokes, and wish happiness for Brianna to have
   for the rest of her life.

   “They’re like this physical representation of ‘this is all of the stuff
   I’m going to miss,'” she [100]explained to ABC News. “I’m going to miss
   everything and I never like missing anything. I’m always the last one
   to leave the party.”

   McManamy also said she has created some videos for Brianna to view as
   she gets older. She said the most important thing is for her daughter
   to be happy, even if she’s not there.

   “I don’t care what she does in her life,” she [101]said. “I just want
   her to find her happiness. Life is short. If she’s true to herself,
   everything will be OK.”
