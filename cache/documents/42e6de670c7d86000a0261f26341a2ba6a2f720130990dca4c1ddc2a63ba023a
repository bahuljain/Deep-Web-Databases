     __________________________________________________________________

   Q: What type of patient is a good candidate for cholesterol-lowering
   statin medications?
   A: Anybody who has established cardiovascular disease is placed on a
   statin. Its shown to reduce cardiovascular events regardless of the
   entry LDL cholesterol level. We target the therapy based on how
   high-risk that individual is.
   For people who are free of cardiovascular disease, the initiation of
   therapy depends on where the LDL cholesterol level is in relation to
   their overall cardiovascular profile. For the people who are at lowest
   risk, we intervene at higher levels of LDL cholesterol. For people who
   are at the highest risk, we intervene when the LDL cholesterol is
   lower. You match the intensity of therapy not based on cholesterol
   alonenot in a voidbut in the context of the other [96]risk factors.
   Q: Do you find that many patients dont take their statin medication?
   A: I dont think adherence to statins is any different than for any
   other medication that treats an asymptomatic condition, such as blood
   pressure. In preventive therapy people need to understand how important
   it is to take their [97]medications regularly.
   We deal with this all the time. For example, if someone who has
   [98]heart failure doesnt take his water pill, hes going to feel short
   of breaththeres going to be a very clear signal. But when we treat a
   condition like high cholesterol, theres less compliance because its
   asymptomatic.
   Q: Are patients able to stop statin therapy easily once they start?
   A: If you stop the medication, your cholesterol will return to baseline
   after a very short period of time, about four to six weeks. The whole
   point is that you get placed on a statin if your risk and LDL
   cholesterol is high enough. And we have to think about the lifetime
   risk of cardiovascular disease. The fact is, cardiovascular disease is
   the leading cause of death in industrialized societies. People with
   persistently high LDL cholesterol should expect to go on a statin for a
   lifetimeunless its somebody who ate a poor diet and didnt have the
   motivation, and now they do have the motivation to change their diet
   and lose weight. If theres a change in therapeutic lifestyle, you can
   always reevaluate.
   Q: How has the availability of generic medications changed statin
   therapy?
   A: The models that evaluated the use of statins in people with high
   cholesterol were based on a time when the statins were not generic.
   Since we have cheaper medications now, we should be using statins more
   frequently, not less frequently, because the burden of heart disease is
   so high in industrialized societies.
