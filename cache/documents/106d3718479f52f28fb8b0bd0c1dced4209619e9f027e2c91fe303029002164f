   Who's on your diabetes dream team?
   (ARTIGA PHOTO/CORBIS)
   Type 2 diabetes affects your entire body, from the brain down to the
   nerves of your feet and everything in between. So when it comes to
   taking care of your health, you'll need a diabetes health-care team.
   A team of doctors (and the resulting appointments) might sound tedious,
   but this type of care has been shown to be better than others for
   treating type 2 diabetes.
   What your team can do for you
   In one study published in the American Journal of Medicine in 1995,
   people who were hospitalized for diabetes were released 56% more
   quickly if they had a team of providers rather than just an internist
   and 35% more quickly than if they were only seeing an endocrinologist.
   Team care can do the following.
     * Help lower your blood sugar
     * Improve your chances of seeing your providers in a timely manner
     * Improve your quality of life
     * Improve your satisfaction with your care

   "When addressing the importance of the team approach with my patients,
   I use the analogy of the U.S. Olympic Basketball Teamthe Dream Team. A
   team of professionals coming together for one common goal," says
   Constance Brown-Riggs, RD, a diabetes educator who is author of Eating
   Soulfully and Healthfully With Diabetes.

   "The person with diabetes is the captain, and the primary care
   physician is the coach of the diabetes dream team," she says. "Other
   members of the team might include nurses, registered dietitians,
   exercise physiologists, podiatrists, ophthalmologists, dentists, mental
   health specialists, and pharmacists."
   One health-care provider should coordinate your care. In general, there
   are three core members of your team (besides yourself), at least one of
   whom should be a certified diabetes educator.
     * A main diabetes health-care provider (usually a physician) who
       coordinates care with other specialists
     * A nurse
     * A dietitian

   In some cases, an endocrinologist could be your main health-care
   provider, although primary care physicians, such as [100]internists or
   family doctors, provide 80% to 95% of diabetes care in America.
