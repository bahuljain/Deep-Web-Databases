   Best Answer:  because it can give you high blood pressure, can be the
   cause of narrowing of your blood vessels due to the build up of fats on
   the vessel walls, making your heart pump harder. It may now lead to
   blockage in your vessels or heart attack, etc..^_^

       Dietitics is a complex field so first beware of general statements.
       The concept of 'Too much' fat is relative: (1) how much energy do
       you spend (exercise, etc...) (2) what type of fat do you eat so
       much of? (3) how is your metabolism.
       To simplify, if you digest easily, you eat unsaturated fat and you
       exercise very regularly, then it may take a lot of fat before it is
       too much. Otherwise I think your main concern should be the fat
       clogging up your arteries.
       For the rest, if you care about your body, spare some time to read
       more about nutrition. Start with www.eatwell.gov.uk. After all if
       you are a taxpayer, you are paying for these 'free' websites, so
       you might as well use them!

       Because the body can't digest too much of the stuff and leaves
       fatty deposits all round the body, including in your veins which
       makes it harder for blood to circulate round your body and your
       heart which means it has to work harder just to get the same
       result.
       All the extra fat makes you a lot heavier which means that you have
       to work a lot harder just to move and need more oxygen, that puts a
       strain on your lungs which have to work harder to send it to the
       heart which is already working harder than the average sized
       person.
       Saying all that, I'm 21.5 stones - I was 25 stones last year and
       very fit. I have a very active job where I'm walking for hours on
       end. I am a very good swimmer and have recently had an ECG and not
       only was my heart rate normal, it was a bit slow - which is good
       apparently.
       I've just phoned in sick at work for the first time in three years,
       I had two days off with the flu that's been going around, that's
       the worst I ever seem to get.

       Fat is a source of highly concentrated calories. Too much fat, or
       the wrong type of fat, can be the cause of serious illness.
       You must take in a balance of nutrients to allow your body to
       correctly function. Too much fat and insufficient protien or
       carbohydrates slowly impacts on how your body functions over time.
       After a while, if your body receives insufficient nutrients of one
       or more types, and receives an overdose of fat, it will handle the
       fat as best it can.
       If you are consuming plenty of calcium then your body might be able
       to eliminate excess fat, but if you are eating too much fat and
       insufficient calcium your body will store the surplus fat within
       your body cells rather than get rid of it....result....a much
       fatter body.
       As to the type of fat, the good fats are oils such as olive,
       canola, linseed and wallnut. They are all better eaten raw rather
       than cooked. The bad ones are oils such as vegetable oil and
       cottonseed oil. Strangely these bad ones are the types that are
       generally used in many food outlets because they are
       cheap....no-one ever said that public eateries have to provide you
       with the best foods for your health!!

       Your body gets way too much food if you over eat and not use the
       energy. The food then turns to fat. If you keep on overeating and
       not exercising of using the energy, you get more and more stored
       fat. Overeating leads to obesity and illnesses like diabetes,high
       blood pressure,etc. I eat alot too, from time to time. I'm not some
       bone, it runs in my family, obesity so I work hard to look good.I'm
       still not perfect but it's who you are in the inside that counts
       but people can be so judgemental; judging people by how they look.
       If you're too skinny,(genetics people, fast metabolism), then
       you're thought to be anorexic or bulmic. If you're over weight or a
       little fat b/c of whatever reason genetic or self indulgent , then
       you're a cow. Society is very judgemental, they really need to look
       at themselves, who they are, inside and out before they look at
       anyone!!!!!!!It's good to eat but don't over do it, your body and
       face will show the result of overindulugence. Watch what you eat,
       eat what you really want and indulge every once and while.I used to
       think that some people ate like birds b/c they had self image
       problems but they are just trying to maintain their ideal weight
       and keep it off, staying healthy away from illnesses. You help your
       body the long run if you keep healthy, not eating so much and
       eating here and there alot. It really pays off with your looks and
       inner body.

       Your body has 3 ways to get energy at the cellular level- sugar,
       fat, protein. Sugar is the first choice, because it is easy for a
       cell to convert it to energy. Fat is harder to break down, so your
       body will use whatever sugar is available. It's really complicated,
       but if you want to look it up on wikipedia A good place to start
       would be to look up glycolosis.

       Cholesterol build up for one then obesity, Then it's the
       Governments fault because you can't control what you're shovelling
       inside you.then the Govt have to help you become healthy
       again.There is an underlying factor here can you guess what it is ?
       don't eat fat, pure and simple.If it is not the Govt 's fault
       it's a communist plot, to make us all lardies and take over
       Macdonalds.

       because many of the fats that we eat are not able to be metabolised
       by the body and become stored as fat. saturated fats are the major
       contributor of these stored fats. That's why they suggest eating
       healthy oils such as olive oils and staying away from animals fats
       such as lard.

       Eating too much of anything is bad for you, even the healthy stuff
       if you get too much will make you sick. So, of course, eating too
       much unhealthy stuff cannot possibly be good for you and if you
       don't balance it out well enough, it could be very bad for you.
