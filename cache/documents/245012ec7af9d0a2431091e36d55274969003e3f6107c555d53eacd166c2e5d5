A 15-Minute Workout to Change Your Fat to Muscle

   The truth is you can’t turn one type of tissue into another. But you
   can burn more fat and build muscle with short, intense bursts of
   exercise that raise your heart rate and get your body working as
   efficiently as possible.

   This type of high-intensity training over a short period of time
   [99]can actually burn more fat than moderately-paced, longer
   [100]cardio sessions. The key to a workout like this is to strap on a
   [101]heart rate monitor and keep your heart rate at 80% of your target.
   Try this 15-minute workout every day to start seeing real results.

   1. 30 Seconds of Burpees
     * Begin in a squat position with hands on the floor in front of you.
     * Kick your feet back to a pushup position.
     * Immediately return your feet to the squat position.
     * Leap up as high as possible from the squat position.

   15 Seconds of Rest

   Take 15 seconds to catch your breath!

   2. 20 Split Lunges on Each side
     * Stand with one foot forward and one leg behind you.
     * Bend both knees and lower your body weight down towards the floor
       keeping your chest lifted and shoulders open and relaxed.
     * Then push up explosively and jump off the ground.
     * Switch your legs in mid air and then land with your opposite feet
       forward and back from where your started.
     * As you land, bend both knees so as to soften the landing.
     * Push back up again explosively and switch your legs around back to
       start position.

   15 Seconds of Rest

   3. 30 Seconds of [102]Mountain Climbers
     * Begin in a pushup position on the hands and toes
     * Bring the right knee in towards the chest, resting the foot on the
       floor
     * Jump up and switch feet in the air, bringing the left foot in and
       the right foot
     * Continue alternating the feet as fast as you can

   4. 20 More Split Lunges on Each Side

   15 Seconds of Rest

   5. 30 Seconds of Tricep Towers
     * Start in a plank position on your elbows and toes.
     * Keeping your alignment and go onto your hands, one side at a time.
     * Go back down to resting on your elbows
