   Combining aerobic, resistance exercise may be best for diabetes Reuters

   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Exercise programs that combine aerobic
   exercise and resistance training may be better at helping people with
   diabetes control their blood sugar than either type of exercise alone,
   a new analysis of past studies says.
   “It has been well established that exercise training is better than
   doing nothing,” Lukas Schwingshackl told Reuters Health in an email. He
   led the study at the University of Vienna in Austria.
   “One of the more important questions that remains to be answered is
   which exercise modality offers the most benefits,” Schwingshackl added.
   He said that previous reviews found exercise programs to be beneficial
   for blood sugar control but none made head-to-head comparisons of
   aerobic exercise, resistance training and a combination of the two.
   For their review, Schwingshackl and his colleagues searched for studies
   that had randomly assigned people with diabetes to different exercise
   programs lasting at least eight weeks.
   They found 14 studies with a total of 915 participants that met their
   criteria.
   The researchers found that aerobic exercise appeared to be more
   effective than resistance training at reducing HbA1C, a measure of
   blood sugar control, and fasting blood sugar.
   Combined training programs were even more effective than aerobic
   exercise alone for reducing HbA1C and more effective than resistance
   training alone for reducing HbA1C, fasting blood sugar and
   triglycerides, according to the results published in Diabetologia.
   Many of the studies were of low quality and all of them involved
   supervised training only, the researchers note. They say that in the
   real world, it’s more likely that people would exercise on their own.
   Future studies of long-term exercise programs assessing rates of heart
   disease and death among people with diabetes, for instance, “are needed
   to develop definitive recommendations,” Schwingshackl said.
   He said the American College of Sports Medicine has stated that
   combining resistance training and aerobic exercise for at least 150
   minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week may be more effective
   at improving blood sugar control than focusing solely on one type of
   training.
   “I think it’s really important for people with diabetes to remember
   that exercise is a critical component of being well - you can’t do it
   with just diet,” Dr. Patrick McBride told Reuters Health. He was not
   involved in the study.
   McBride, who runs a diabetes prevention and management program at the
   University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison, said that regular exercise
   can help lower blood sugar levels.
   “I always tell people that if they exercise more than 30 minutes
   they’ll burn up blood sugar for 24 hours,” he said.
   Having a combined program of aerobic exercise and strength training is
   important, McBride added.
   “We always talk about how fitness is being strong and having good
   endurance and being flexible - so it’s good to have a combined
   program,” he said. “That’s what the emphasis of this study was, being
   both strong and having good endurance - that was best for people with
   diabetes.”
   McBride said that people who have diabetes or want to prevent diabetes
   can find personal trainers who are exercise physiologists at most good
   health clubs and YMCAs.
   “These are people with degrees in exercise science and they know all
   about this,” he said.
