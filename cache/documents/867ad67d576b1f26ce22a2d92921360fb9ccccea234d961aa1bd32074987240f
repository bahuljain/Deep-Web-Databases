Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries. It most often
occurs in women over 50. Ovarian cancer may cause no symptoms at all, or
cause symptoms, such as bloating, abdominal pain, and trouble eating, that
can be mistaken for other conditions. Although it’s difficult to catch
ovarian cancer earlyabout 20% of ovarian cancers are detected before they
spread outside the ovarythere are treatments that can help.

     * [101]Study Links Having Children to Lower Ovarian Cancer Risk
       TUESDAY, Nov. 3, 2015 (HealthDay News) — The more children a woman
       has, the lower her risk of ovarian cancer may be, a new study
       suggests. The study also found that the risk is lower in women
       whose fallopian tubes have been tied — a procedure called tubal
       ligation. British researchers analyzed data from more than 8,000
       [...]
     * [102]What You Should Know Before a Breast Cancer Gene Test
       Only about one-third of women receive genetic counseling before
       they undergo testing to see if they have a gene mutation that
       increases their risk of breast or ovarian cancer, a new study
       reports.
     * [103]Why Screening All Women for Breast Cancer Genes Isn’t Worth It
       Screening all women for gene mutations that increase the risk of
       breast and ovarian cancer is too costly to be feasible, a new study
       suggests.

       By Amy NortonHealthDay Reporter MONDAY, Aug. 24, 2015 (HealthDay
       News) — Ovarian cancer patients who use certain blood pressure
       drugs often live longer than other women with the disease,
       researchers report in a finding that hints at a potential new
       treatment for the deadly cancer. The study, of over 1,400 women
       with ovarian cancer, found that those [...]

       By Dennis ThompsonHealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Aug. 13, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Some women with a family history of breast or
       ovarian cancer might benefit from a broader genetic test that
       includes more than 20 genes that have been found to increase cancer
       risk, a new study suggests. Genetic tests have tended to focus
       solely on BRCA1 and [...]
