[106]What Cholesterol Tests Reveal About Your Heart's Health

   Surprise! Your total number matters a lot less than the ratios. Here's
   how doctors look at it
   [107]mark-miller
   "My cholesterol tested high and the doctors told me to lose weight, but
   it just went over my head," says Mark Miller, 62, a teacher and
   football coach from Linden, Calif. Miller weighed 380 pounds five years
   ago, when he suffered two heart attacks just three days
   apart...  [108]Read More

   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

[109]Dr. Robert Rosenson's Myths and Facts About Cholesterol

   [110]Dr. Robert Rosenson
   Dr. Robert Rosenson
   Cardiologist, University of Michigan
   Q: Is the "total cholesterol" number my doctor talks about obsolete, or
   does it still have some value?
   A: It has some relevance because, typically, the higher the
   cholesterol, the higher the bad cholesterolbut it also could be the
   higher the good cholesterol. And that’s why we focus on HDL and LDL
   cholesterol. By focusing on the total cholesterol, people can often be
   misled about their risk [for cardiovascular disease] being too high or
   too low. One can have total cholesterol of 175 and HDL cholesterol of
   25 and be at incredibly high risk for a cardiovascular event. By
   contrast, one can have total cholesterol of 240 and HDL cholesterol of
   65 and not be at increased risk. So it’s the components that comprise
   the total cholesterol that are important. [111]Read More

[112]How Cholesterol Affects Your Heart's Health

   Too much is bad, and so is too little. Here's what you need to know
   about fats in your blood
   [113]heart-chest-cholesterol
   When most people hear "cholesterol" they think "evil." The reality is
   more complex; cholesterol can be bad and good. On its own, cholesterol
   is a crucial body component. That's why you make the white, waxy
   substance (about 75% of the cholesterol in your blood is made by the
   liver and cells elsewhere in your body). Cholesterol insulates nerve
   cells in your brain and provides structure for cell
   membranes.  [114]Read More

[118]How I Survived a Heart Attack at 43

   He thought the pressure in his chest was indigestion. He was very wrong
   [119]francisco-menendez
   When I had my heart attack at 43, all my doctors were really surprised.
   I was young, I’m not overweight, and I don’t eat a lot of fatty foods.
   In fact, I never eat junk food. My father had a heart attack, but he
   was in his 70s, so that is not a significant risk factor...  [120]Read
