   Cholesterol no longer a concern: US experts AFP Thursday, February 19,
   2015
   Kerry Sheridan
   Miami (AFP) - More butter, anyone?
   A warning against eating foods high in cholesterol is no longer
   included in the US government's draft dietary guidelines for Americans,
   representing a major shift in policy, officials said Thursday.
   Until now, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that
   cholesterol intake be limited to 300 milligrams per day -- the amount
   in about one stick of butter, or two small eggs, or a 10-ounce (300
   gram) steak.
   Medical experts used to believe that eating too much cholesterol could
   raise the risk of heart attack and stroke by contributing to plaque
   buildup in the arteries.
   But the 2015 version of the guidelines will no longer place an upper
   limit on cholesterol "because available evidence shows no appreciable
   relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum
   cholesterol," the US Department of Agriculture said in a statement.
   The draft report, published online at health.gov/dietaryguidelines,
   said "cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption."
   The recommended changes were compiled by 14 nationally recognized
   nutrition, medicine and public health experts.
   The guidelines do not become official right away. Instead, they are
   open for a 45-day comment period and will be discussed at a public
   meeting in Bethesda, Maryland on March 24.
   "We have seen this controversy, especially surrounding the consumption
   of eggs, which are very high in cholesterol yet filled with beneficial
   nutrients," said Suzanne Steinbaum, preventive cardiologist at Lenox
   Hill Hospital in New York.
   The committee "clearly is trying to dispel the idea that cholesterol
   matters."
   - Saturated fat -
   While cholesterol may be getting a free pass, the saturated fat that
   usually accompanies it is not.
   In fact, experts recommend that Americans eat less than before.
   Calories from saturated fat should make up about eight percent of a
   person's daily calorie intake, compared to the 2010 guidelines that
   advised 10 percent.
   For an average person, eating 2,000 calories per day, the new
   guidelines would mean the limit of saturated fat could be achieved with
   a few spoonfuls of butter, or a dozen eggs -- since eggs are naturally
   low in saturated fat -- or a seven-ounce steak.
   "Saturated fat is still a nutrient of concern for overconsumption,
   particularly for those older than the age of 50 years," said the
   report.
   The recommended changes show "good progress in the arena of nutrition
   science," said Rebecca Solomon, director of clinical nutrition at Mount
   Sinai Beth Israel hospital in New York.
   "We have known for many years that cholesterol levels are impacted
   primarily by genetics and high saturated fat intake and not by intake
   of dietary cholesterol. I am happy to see this evolved position."
   - Sustainable eating -
   The overarching theme of the draft guidelines was to urge Americans to
   eat more fruit and vegetables, and Mediterranean and vegetarian diets
   were recommended as healthy options.
   "A diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole
   grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based
   foods is more health-promoting and is associated with less
   environmental impact than is the current US diet," the report said.
   Environmental groups applauded the draft's mention of sustainability,
   saying such changes could help reduce global warming and food
   insecurity.
   "The inclusion of sustainability criteria in the Dietary Guidelines'
   recommendations is a huge step forward for human and planetary health,"
   said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager at Friends of the Earth.
   "By recommending consumption of more plant foods and less meat, these
   guidelines will encourage people to lessen the huge impact of our diets
   on our natural resources."
