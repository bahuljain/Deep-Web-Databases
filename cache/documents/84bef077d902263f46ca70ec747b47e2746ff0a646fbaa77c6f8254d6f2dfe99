Meet the NFL’s First Female Coach

   July 28, 2015 | By Jacqueline Andriakos

   Make some room, NFL fellas—there’s a new female coach in town.

   On Monday, the [98]Arizona Cardinals announced their new assistant
   coach, 37-year-old Jen Welter, who is believed to be the first female
   coach in the National Football League’s history.

   Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians hired [99]Welter as an assistant
   coaching intern during training camp and the pre-season to work with
   inside linebackers, ESPN reports.

   RELATED: [100]4 Reasons Women Shouldn’t Fear the Weight Room

   “[101]Coaching is nothing more than teaching,” Arians said Monday,
   according to the team’s announcement. “One thing I have learned from
   players is, ‘How are you going to make me better? If you can make me
   better, I don’t care if you’re the Green Hornet, man, I’ll listen.’ I
   really believe she’ll have a great opportunity with this internship
   through training camp to open some doors for her.”

   Yesterday, Welter toasted the big news [102]on Facebook: “I’m honored
   to be part of the #BIRDGANG! Love the #footballfamily here with the
   #ArizonaCardinals #NFL.”

   She may be new to Phoenix, but Welter has already made quite a name for
   herself in the football world with a career spanning more than 14 years
   on multiple semi-pro teams. ([103]Fun facts: she played rugby at Boston
   College and has a master’s degree in sports psychology and a PhD in
   psychology.)

   The Florida native played professionally mainly as a linebacker with
   the Dallas Diamonds of the Women’s Football Alliance and helped the
   team win four titles. She also played at the [104]International
   Federation of American Football (IFAF) Women’s World Championship in
   2010 and 2013, helping bring Team USA to two gold medals.

   RELATED: [105]10 Surprising Health Benefits of Being a Woman

   And this isn’t the first time Welter has broken down gender barriers
   while passing the pigskin. The football star [106]made headlines in
   February 2014 after she became the first woman to play a non-kicking
   position in a men’s professional football league as a running back for
   the Texas Revolution of the Indoor Football League in a game against
   the North Texas Crunch.

   “I said, ‘Is that all you got?’ ” Welter told the Dallas Morning News
   at the time. “I didn’t want [the players] to think [107]I was
   intimidated.”

   A year after her historic running-back move, Welter was named coach for
   the Texas Revolution linebackers and special teams, making her the
   first female to coach in a men’s professional football league ever.

   “I want little girls to grow up knowing they can do anything, even
   [108]play football,” Welter told Today last year. “It’s all about
   living in the moment, and the moment for me is right now.”
