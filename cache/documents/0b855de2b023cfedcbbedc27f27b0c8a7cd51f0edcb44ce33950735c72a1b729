   Second Dallas nurse with Ebola was on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143

   DALLAS – A second nurse who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan
   has been diagnosed with the deadly disease — a day after flying from
   Ohio to Texas, officials said.
   CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said during a national news conference on
   Wednesday that Dallas nurse Amber Joy Vinson “was in a group of
   individuals known to have exposure to Ebola, she should not have
   traveled on a commercial airline.”
   But according to multiple news reports, Vinson phoned the CDC before
   leaving Ohio to report she had an elevated fever of 99.5 degrees and
   would be flying back to Dallas. Vinson wasn't “told she couldn't fly,”
   an unidentified CDC source [2]told ABC News.
   “Somebody dropped the ball,” [3]CBS News quoted one health official as
   saying.
   Vinson, who was in Ohio last weekend to plan her wedding, was not
   experiencing symptoms when she made the flight from Cleveland to
   Dallas-Fort Worth late Monday, Frieden said.
   About 24 hours later Vinson, 29, was placed in isolation at Texas
   Health Presbyterian.
   “The second health care worker case is very concerning,” Frieden said
   earlier Wednesday. “Our thoughts are with the individual and the
   individual's family.”
   Because Vinson’s condition has worsened, federal officials said she
   will be treated at a biocontainment unit at Emory University Hospital.
   An air ambulance carried her to Atlanta Wednesday evening.
   The CDC is asking that all 132 passengers on Monday’s Frontier Airlines
   flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas-Fort Worth call 1-800-CDC-INFO.
   The flight landed at 8:16 p.m. CT Monday.
   Since Vinson didn’t have a fever and wasn’t vomiting on the flight, it
   “suggests to us that the risk to any person around that individual on
   the plane would have been extremely low,” Frieden said.
   Dallas was Flight 1143's last stop on Monday and Frontier said the
   aircraft “received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures.” But
   Flightaware.com, a flight-monitoring website, [4]told the Los Angeles
   Times that the Airbus A320 made five additional flights on Tuesday
   before being taken out of service for decontamination on Wednesday.
   Going forward, Frieden said, no one else involved in Duncan's care will
   be allowed to travel “other than in a controlled environment.”
   [5]The White House conceded on Wednesday that there have been
   “shortcomings” in the response to the Dallas Ebola crisis. “It's not
   clear what protocols were in place and how those protocols were
   implemented,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said during a news
   conference.
   Vinson was among 76 hospital workers who cared for Duncan, a Liberian
   citizen who died from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian a week ago.
   Her colleague, Nina Pham, was diagnosed with the virus on Sunday and is
   also in isolation at their hospital. Pham, 26, was in good condition on
   Wednesday, the hospital said.
   It has not been determined how either nurse was infected, but Frieden
   said investigators are focusing on the Sept. 28-30 time frame. An
   ambulance rushed Duncan to the hospital on Sept. 28, and he was placed
   in “strict isolation.” Two days later, Duncan was officially diagnosed
   as the first Ebola case in the United States.
   Vinson and Pham worked those days and had “extensive contact with the
   patient when he was having substantial amounts of both vomiting and
   diarrhea,” Frieden said.
   Federal investigators, Frieden said, have learned that the hospital
   used various forms of personal protective gear during Duncan’s first
   days at Texas Health Presbyterian. Medical records provided by Duncan's
   family show that hospital staffers didn't trade in their gowns and
   scrubs for hazmat suits until the CDC confirmed his Ebola diagnosis,
   [6]the Associated Press reported.
   “There are several ways to use personal protective equipment safely,”
   Frieden said. “It’s critical that that be done consistently and
   correctly. That’s one of the areas of active investigation.”
   At an early-morning news conference, a bleary-eyed Dr. Daniel Varga,
   the hospital's chief clinical officer, called Vinson's infection “an
   unprecedented crisis.”
   “We’re a hospital that may have done some things differently with the
   benefit of what we know today,” Varga said. “Make no mistake: No one
   wants to get this right more than our hospital.”
   Throughout the day, local and federal authorities warned that Vinson
   and Pham may only represent the beginning of the spread of Ebola to the
   United States.
   “This second health care worker case is very concerning,” Frieden said.
   “We are planning for the possibility of additional cases in the coming
   days.”
   Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins called the second diagnosis a “gut
   shot” to the hospital staff and acknowledged that officials were
   scouting additional hospitals with isolation rooms, should they be
   needed.
   “That is a very real possibility,” he said.
   A hazardous-materials team is now decontaminating Vinson's Dallas
   apartment in a community not far from the hospital. City officials said
   she lived alone and had no pets.
   “This is a heroic person, a person who has dedicated her life to
   helping others and is a servant leader,” Jenkins said.
   Vinson, a nurse in Texas for two years, was in Ohio visiting family
   near Akron. She arrived in Cleveland last Saturday on Frontier Flight
   1142, according to the airline.
   Vinson attended Kent State University and is related to three employees
   there, [7]Reuters reported. University officials said she did not visit
   the campus on her recent trip home.
   “Out of an abundance of caution, we're asking the patient's family
   members to remain off campus for the next 21 days and self-monitor per
   CDC protocol,” Dr. Angela DeJulius, Kent State's health services
   director, said in a statement.
   In addition to the more than 70 hospital workers being monitored, an
   additional 48 people who had either direct or indirect contact with
   Duncan before he was hospitalized are being watched for Ebola symptoms.
   None have shown signs of the illness so far, officials said.
   Duncan, who had traveled from West Africa to Dallas days before
   becoming ill, was the first person to be diagnosed with the virus in
   the United States. The disease, for which there is no known cure, has
   killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa in 2014, the World Health
   Organization estimates.
   “I continue to believe that while Dallas is anxious about this — and,
   with this news this morning, the anxiety level goes up a level — we are
   not fearful,” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said. “It may get worse before
   it gets better, but it will get better.”
