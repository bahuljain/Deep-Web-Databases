Watch This Basketball Player’s Adorable Daughter Take Over His
Press Conference

   Post-game press conferences are typically a dull affair, where players
   repeat the same basic phrases—“We played well,” “It was a tough loss”
   or, if you’re Marshawn Lynch, [100]“I’m just here so I don’t get
   fined,” over and over again.

   But Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry’s press conference
   was a much more adorable affair when he made the last-minute decision
   to [101]bring his two-year-old daughter Riley along. She immediately
   stole the show, climbing all over her MVP dad and hamming it up for the
   reporters with Queen Elizabeth-style waves while popping out from under
   the tablecloth. The best part had to be when Riley started chattering
   to Curry, so he asked her to “hold on a second, OK?” Her
   hilarious-in-a-two-year-old-way response? “Be quiet.”

   Somehow, though, there are multiple reporters that are [102]upset with
   Curry for bringing Riley to the press conference because there are
   “professionals on deadlines there w/ jobs to do, too,” according to one
   [103]now-deleted tweet from a reporter at the Wilmington Star-News.

   [104]D-Rose's son and Curry's daughter react to a reporter saying they
   shouldn't be at press conferences.

   In our office, we were thrilled to see another kid on the podium. (It’s
   a growing trend: Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose brought his son
   P.J. to a press conference last week, and he quickly [105]became an
   internet meme; back in 2011, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning
   brought his then-infant son along when he talked to the press, and
   little Marshall [106]tried to eat the microphones.) These guys are
   showing the world that dads, not just moms, are childcare providers
   too, and sometimes they need to bring their kid to work—especially when
   their pregnant wives, [107]in Curry’s case, need a quick break.

   So instead of calling for the NBA to ban kids from the podium, as one
   [108]ESPN reporter apparently suggested, let’s applaud them. Bringing
   their kids to press conferences injects some humor into a typically
   dull interview, humanizes these millionaire athletes, and proves that
   at least some of these guys are great dads. And oh yeah, it’s adorable.
