   People with diabetes have a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of
   dying from the complications of cardiovascular disease. Both men and
   women are at increased risk. Atherosclerosis and vascular thrombosis
   are major contributors, and it is generally accepted that platelets are
   contributory. Platelets from men and women with diabetes are often
   hypersensitive in vitro to platelet aggregating agents. A major
   mechanism is increased production of thromboxane, a potent
   vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregant. Investigators have found
   evidence in vivo of excess thromboxane release in type 2 diabetic
   patients with cardiovascular disease. Aspirin blocks thromboxane
   synthesis by acetylating platelet cyclo-oxygenase and has been used as
   a primary and secondary strategy to prevent cardiovascular events in
   nondiabetic and diabetic individuals. Meta-analyses of these studies
   and large-scale collaborative trials in men and women with diabetes
   support the view that low-dose aspirin therapy should be prescribed as
   a secondary prevention strategy, if no contraindications exist.
   Substantial evidence suggests that low-dose aspirin therapy should also
   be used as a primary prevention strategy in men and women with diabetes
   who are at high risk for cardiovascular events.^1

   EFFICACY
   Secondary Prevention Trials
   A meta-analysis of 145 prospective controlled trials of antiplatelet
   therapy in men and women after myocardial infarction, stroke or
   transient ischemic attack, or positive cardiovascular history (vascular
   surgery, angioplasty, angina, etc.) has been reported by the
   Anti-Platelet Trialists (APT). Reductions in vascular events were about
   one-quarter in each of these categories, and diabetic subjects had risk
   reductions that were comparable to nondiabetic individuals. There was a
   trend toward increased risk reductions with doses of aspirin of 325
   mg/day or less. It was estimated that 38 12 vascular events per 1,000
   diabetic patients would be prevented if they were treated with aspirin
   as a secondary prevention strategy. Comparable results were seen in
   males and females.

   These results are supported by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
   Study (ETDRS). This population consisted of type 1 and type 2 diabetic
   men and women, about 48% of whom had a history of cardiovascular
   disease. The study, therefore, may be viewed as a mixed primary and
   secondary prevention trial. The relative risk for myocardial infarction
   in the first 5 years in those randomized to aspirin therapy was lowered
   significantly to 0.72 (CI 0.550.95).

   Primary Prevention Trials
   The U.S. Physicians Health Study was a primary prevention trial in
   which a low-dose aspirin regimen (325 mg every other day) was compared
   with placebo in male physicians. There was a 44% risk reduction in the
   treated group, and subgroup analyses in the diabetic physicians
   revealed a reduction in myocardial infarction from 10.1% (placebo) to
   4.0% (aspirin), yielding a relative risk of 0.39 for the diabetic men
   on aspirin therapy.

   SAFETY
   A major risk of aspirin therapy is gastric mucosal injury and
   gastrointestinal hemorrhage. These effects are dose related and are
   reduced to placebo levels when enteric-coated preparations of 75325 mg
   are used once daily. Minor bleeding episodes (epistaxis, bruising,
   etc.) may occur at low doses, probably from the effect of aspirin to
   inhibit the platelet release reaction. In several prospective studies,
   a trend for an increase in hemorrhagic stroke has been seen, but has
   not reached statistical significance. Contraindications to aspirin
   therapy include allergy, bleeding tendency, anticoagulant therapy,
   recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically active hepatic
   disease.

   The ETDRS established that aspirin therapy was not associated with an
   increased risk for retinal or vitreous hemorrhage. Since the primary
   endpoint in this trial was retinopathy and maculopathy, these serial
   observations by ophthalmologists, using retinal photography in a group
   of diabetic subjects with retinopathy, established conclusively that
   aspirin therapy conveyed no increase in benefit or in risk regarding
   progression of diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy.

   Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the
   risk for chronic renal disease and may impair blood pressure control in
   hypertensive patients. However, a low dose of aspirin is a very weak
   inhibitor of renal prostaglandin synthesis and has no clinically
   significant effect on renal function or on blood pressure control.

   DOSAGE
   The platelet release reaction is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by
   aspirin. In this regard, it has been shown that a dose as low as 75 mg
   of enteric-coated aspirin is just as effective as higher doses of
   either plain or enteric-coated aspirin in inhibiting thromboxane
   synthesis. When platelet turnover is rapid, as may be the case with
   diabetic vascular disease, the steady plasma aspirin concentration from
   enteric preparations theoretically allows for constant suppression of
   thromboxane synthesis.

   The APT meta-analysis explored the results achieved with various doses
   of aspirin, alone or in combination with other antiplatelet agents,
   including dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone. Whereas risk reductions of
   21 4% were seen in cardiovascular events in 30 trials in which doses of
   5001,500 mg/day were used; a trend for greater risk reductions of 29
   7% was seen in 5,000 patients in whom doses of 75 mg/day were used.
   Comparable risk reductions of 28 3% were seen in 12 trials in which
   doses of 160325 mg/day were used. No evidence was found that
   combinations of aspirin with other antiplatelet drugs were any more
   effective than aspirin alone.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
   The meta-analysis of the secondary prevention trials provided sample
   sizes that were adequate to determine aspirins efficacy in a wide
   variety of patients. Separate analyses were done in males and females,
   patients with or without diastolic hypertension, those over or under
   age 65 years, and in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Proportional
   benefits of aspirin therapy were seen in all subgroups studied.
   Absolute benefit was greater among those at high risk (over age 65
   years, diastolic hypertension, diabetes). Intervention trials in women
   are underway. Case control studies have shown that the use of one to
   six aspirins a week is associated with a reduced risk for myocardial
   infarction in women. Further, the APT meta-analysis of secondary
   prevention trials showed no difference in responses in men or women,
   and the ETDRS included men and women in the trial. Diabetes appears to
   place women at high risk for myocardial infarction. For these reasons,
   recommendations in this article apply to men and women with diabetes.

   Although data are limited in diabetic subjects, antiplatelet agents
   such as ticlopidine may be considered as a substitute in the case of
   aspirin allergy. One large-scale collaborative trial (Ticlopidine
   Microangiopathy of Diabetes [TIMAD]) showed that ticlopidine may slow
   progression of retinopathy. Other approaches, such as blocking a key
   platelet receptor (GPIIb/IIIa), are under study.

   RECOMMENDATIONS
   1. Use aspirin therapy as a secondary prevention strategy in diabetic
   men and women who have evidence of large vessel disease. This includes
   diabetic men and women with a history of myocardial infarction,
   vascular bypass procedure, stroke or transient ischemic attack,
   peripheral vascular disease, claudication, and/or angina.

   2. In addition to treating the primary cardiovascular risk factor(s)
   identified, consider aspirin therapy as a primary prevention strategy
   in high-risk men and women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This
   includes diabetic subjects with the following:
     * A family history of coronary heart disease
     * Cigarette smoking
     * Hypertension
     * Obesity (>120% desirable weight); BMI >28 in women, >27.3 in men
     * Albuminuria (micro or macro)
     * Lipids:

     Cholesterol >200 mg/dl
     LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dl
     HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dl
     Triglycerides >250 mg/dl

   Use of aspirin has not been studied in diabetic individuals under the
   age of 30 years.

   3. Use enteric-coated aspirin in doses of 81325 mg/day.

   4. People with aspirin allergy, bleeding tendency, anticoagulant
   therapy, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically active
   hepatic disease are not candidates for aspirin therapy.
