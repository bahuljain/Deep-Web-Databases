17 Red-Flag Signs of Cancer

   17 Red-Flag Signs of Cancer

   A new study shows the likelihood of developing cancer over a lifetime

   One in two people will develop cancer over the course of their lives,
   according to a new report from Cancer Research UK.

   This number is creeping higher than past estimates, which have often
   cited a one-in-three figure. According to the new study published in
   the British Journal of Cancer, the [80]odds of getting cancer over the
   course of one‚Äôs life jumped from 38.5 percent for men born in 1930 to
   53.5 percent for men born in 1960. The hike was from 36.7 percent to
   47.5 percent in women.

   According to the [81]American Cancer Society, the United States has
   very similar figures. Although health care is actually improving ‚Äî in
   the UK, for instance, researchers note the cancer survival rate has
   doubled over the past 40 years ‚Äî there‚Äôs an uptick in disease incidence
   because of the aging population.

   Year

   ‚ÄúCancer is primarily a disease of old age, with more than 60 percent of
   all cases diagnosed in people aged over 65,‚Äù says study author Peter
   Sesieni, a professor of Biostatistics & Cancer Epidemiology and Deputy
   Director of the Centre for Cancer Prevention at Queen Mary University
   of London, in a statement. ‚ÄúIf people live long enough then [83]most
   will get cancer at some point.‚Äù

   This, the researchers say, is why education on cancer prevention is so
   necessary. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot we can do to make it less likely ‚Äî like
   giving up smoking, being more active, drinking less alcohol and
   maintaining a healthy weight,‚Äù Sesieni says. ‚ÄúIf we want to reduce the
   risk of developing the disease we must redouble our efforts and take
   action now to better prevent the disease for future generations.‚Äù

   Most experts also agree that spotting the disease early gives a person
   the best chance of beating it. However, many blow off symptoms as
   bodily quirks ‚Äî and some may well be, but it‚Äôs best to talk to a doctor
   if there‚Äôs an unexplained issue.

   According to Cancer Research UK, which conducted the latest study,
   these are the most [85]common signs of cancer:

   Signs of cancer for men and women:
     * An unusual lump or swelling anywhere on your body
     * A change in the size, shape or colour of a mole
     * A sore that won‚Äôt heal after several weeks
     * A mouth or tongue ulcer that lasts longer than three weeks
     * A cough or croaky voice that lasts longer than three weeks
     * Persistent difficulty swallowing or indigestion
     * Problems passing urine
     * Blood in your urine
     * Blood in your bowel motions
     * A change to more frequent bowel motions that lasts longer than four
       to six weeks
     * Unexplained weight loss or heavy night sweats
     * An unexplained pain or ache that lasts longer than four weeks
     * Breathlessness
     * Coughing up blood

   Signs of cancer for women:
     * An unusual breast change
     * Bleeding from the vagina after the menopause or between periods
     * Persistent bloating

   Now, remember: This news should not cause mass panic, according to the
   UK‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies. People are living longer,
   which is why we‚Äôre seeing more cancer. ‚Äú[86]Cancer survival rates have
   improved to record levels in this country and we are working to raise
   awareness of cancer symptoms so it can be diagnosed earlier, improving
   cancer outcomes,‚Äù she says in the press release. ‚ÄúLeading a healthy
   lifestyle is easily the most effective thing you can do to reduce your
   risk, this means being active, quitting smoking, drinking less alcohol,
   and having a balanced diet.‚Äù
