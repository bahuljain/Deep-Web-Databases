   Best Answer:  The first confirmed case of AIDS was identified on June
   5, 1981. In four stories today, we look at the impact around the
   globe.JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)‚ÄîIt began quietly, when a
   statistical anomaly pointed to a mysterious syndrome that attacked the
   immune systems of gay men in California. No one imagined 25 years ago
   that AIDS would become the deadliest epidemic in history. Since June 5,
   1981, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has killed more than 25 million
   people, infected 40 million others and left a legacy of unspeakable
   loss, hardship, fear and despair.

   Two Million Children with HIV
   HIV Traced to Wild Chimps
   Its spread was hastened by ignorance, prejudice, denial and the
   freedoms of the sexual revolution. Along the way from oddity to
   pandemic, AIDS changed they way people live and love.
   Slowed but unchecked, the epidemic's relentless march has established
   footholds in the world's most populous countries. Advances in medicine
   and prevention that have made the disease manageable in the developed
   world haven't reach the rest.
   In the worst case, sub-Saharan Africa, it has been devastating. And the
   next 25 years of AIDS promise to be deadlier than the first.
   AIDS could kill 31 million people in India and 18 million in China by
   2025, according to projections by U.N. population researchers. By then
   in Africa, where AIDS likely began and where the virus has wrought the
   most devastation, researchers said the toll could reach 100 million.
   "It is the worst and deadliest epidemic that humankind has ever
   experienced,'' Mark Stirling, the director of East and Southern Africa
   for UNAIDS, said in an interview.
   More effective medicines, better access to treatment and improved
   prevention in the last few years have started to lower the grim
   projections. But even if new infections stopped immediately, additional
   African deaths alone would exceed 40 million, Stirling said.
   "We will be grappling with AIDS for the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years,'' he
   said.
   Efforts to find an effective vaccine have failed dismally, so far. The
   International AIDS Vaccine Initiative says 30 are being tested in
   small-scale trials. More money and more efforts are being poured into
   prevention campaigns but the efforts are uneven. Success varies widely
   from region to region, country to country.
   Still, science offers some promise. In highly developed countries,
   cocktails of powerful antiretroviral drugs have largely altered the
   AIDS prognosis from certain death to a manageable chronic illness.
   There is great hope that current AIDS drugs might prevent high-risk
   people from becoming infected. One of these, tenofovir, is being tested
   in several countries. Plans are to test it as well with a second drug,
   emtricitabine or FTC.
   But nothing can be stated with certainty until clinical trials are
   complete, said Anthony Fauci, a leading AIDS researcher and infectious
   diseases chief at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
   And then there is the risk that treatment will create a resistant
   strain or, as some critics claim, cause people to lower their guard and
   have more unprotected sex.
   Medicine offers less hope in the developing world where most victims
   are desperately poor with little or no access to the medical care
   needed to administer and monitor AIDS drugs. Globally, just 1 in 5 HIV
   patients get the drugs they need, according to a recent report by
   UNAIDS, the body leading the worldwide battle against the disease.
   Stirling said that despite the advances, the toll over the next 25
   years will go far beyond the 34 million thought to have died from the
   Black Death in 14th century Europe or the 20 to 40 million who perished
   in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.
   Almost two-thirds of those infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa
   where poverty, ignorance and negligent political leadership extended
   the epidemic's reach and hindered efforts to contain it. In South
   Africa, the president once questioned the link between HIV and AIDS and
   the health minister urged use of garlic and the African potato to fight
   AIDS, instead of effective treatments.
   AIDS is the leading cause of death in Africa, which has accounted for
   nearly half of all global AIDS deaths. The epidemic is still growing
   and its peak could be a decade or more away.
   In at least seven countries, the U.N. estimates that AIDS has reduced
   life expectancy to 40 years or less. In Botswana, which has the world's
   highest infection rate, a child born today can expect to live less than
   30 years.
   "Particularly in southern Africa, we may have to apply a new notion,
   and that is of 'underdeveloping' nations. These are nations which,
   because of the AIDS epidemic, are going backwards,'' Peter Piot, the
   director of UNAIDS, said in a speech in Washington in March.
   Later, at a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, last month, Piot cited
   encouraging news including a sharp fall in new infections in some
   African countries. There also has been an eightfold increase in the
   number of Africans benefiting from antiretroviral treatment, he said.
   But, he warned, "the crisis of AIDS continues and is getting worse and
   any slackening of our efforts would jeopardize the hard-won gains of
   each and every one of us.''
   Besides the personal suffering of the infected and their families, the
   epidemic already has had devastating consequences for African education
   systems, industry, agriculture and economies in general. The impact is
   magnified because AIDS weakens and kills many young adults, people in
   their most productive years.
   So many farmers and farmworkers have died of AIDS that the U.N. has
   invented the term "new variant famine.'' It means that because of AIDS,
   the continent will experience persistent famine for generations instead
   of the usual cycles of hunger tied to variable weather.
   Africa's misery hangs like a sword over Asia, Eastern Europe and the
   Caribbean.
   Researchers don't expect the infection rates to rival those in Africa.
   But Asia's population is so big that even low infection rates could
   easily translate into tens of millions of deaths.
   Although fewer than 1 percent of its people are infected, India has
   topped South Africa as the country with the most infections, 5.7
   million to 5.5 million, according to UNAIDS.
   The astonishing numbers have grown from a humble beginning.
   Nobody knows for sure when or where, but the AIDS epidemic is thought
   to have begun in the primeval forests of West Africa when a virus
   lurking in the blood of a monkey or a chimpanzee made the leap from one
   species to another, infecting a hunter.
   Researchers have found HIV in a blood sample collected in 1959 from a
   man in Kinshasa, Congo. Genetic analysis of his blood suggested the HIV
   infection stemmed from a single virus in the late 1940s or early 1950s.
   For decades at least, the early human infections went unnoticed on a
   continent where life routinely is harsh, short and cheap.
   Then, on June 5, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
   reported five young actively homosexual men in Los Angeles had a new,
   mysterious and as yet unnamed illness that attacked the immune system
   and caused a type of pneumonia. A month later, it reported an odd surge
   among homosexual men in the number of cases of Karposi Sarcoma, a rare
   cancer now linked to AIDS.
   In the early days of the epidemic, just the mention of AIDS elicited
   snickers and jokes. Few saw it as a major threat. It was the "Gay
   Plague,'' and for some, divine retribution for a lifestyle Christian
   fundamentalists and other conservatives consider deviant and sinful.
   When heterosexuals began to contract the disease through blood
   transfusions and other medical procedures, they were often portrayed as
   "innocent'' victims of a disease spread by the immoral and licentious
   behavior of others.
   The initial reactions and prejudices associated with AIDS slowed the
   early response to the epidemic and limited the funding. Too much time,
   money and effort was spent on the wrong priorities, Stirling aid.
   "Over the last 25 years, the one real weakness was the search for the
   magic bullet. There is no quick and simple fix,'' he said. "But with
   the recent successes we are starting to see the end of epidemic.''
   "There is evidence to suggest we are at the tipping point,'' said
   Stirling.
   The pace of change over the last couple of years suggests the number of
   new infections can be reduced by 50 to 60 percent by 2020‚Äîif the
   momentum continues.
   "It is surely possible, it is doable,'' Stirling said.

       A 2007 genetic study suggests that the HIV strains present in the
       early 1980s arrived in the United States from Haiti in the late
       sixties or early seventies. It is believed to have arrived in Haiti
       from central Africa, possibly through professional contacts with
       the newly independent Congo.
       The key facts surrounding this origin of AIDS are currently
       unknown, particularly where and when the pandemic began, though it
       is said that it originated from the apes (SIV) in Africa. A variety
       of theories exist explaining the transfer of HIV to humans, but no
       single hypothesis is unanimously accepted, and the topic remains
       controversial.
       Included is a link to information on AIDS origin:

       How appropriate your question is? AIDS was created. It was not
       caused by a monkey biting a human being in Africa. Many people will
       tell you this because when the disease began to affect more than
       the homosexual population, it became an epidemic. There are
       different theories on how it was created, but it was definitely
       man-made.

       HIV is a virus that is the mutated form of SIV (Simian
       Immunodeficiency Virus), which is able to infect most primates
       except humans. SIV probably mutated to HIV to be able to infect
       humans a couple of hundred years ago. SIV was initially transmitted
       to humans by the killing and consumption of infected primates,
       after which it randomly mutated into HIV. There are areas in
       tropical Africa where SIV is common, so that was the initial source
       area for HIV infections. Once HIV was established in the human
       population, it spread slowly until it reached the larger port
       cities on the coast, where merchant mariners were a probable source
       for the spread of HIV not only in Africa, but worldwide.
       AIDS is the advanced spread of the HIV infection, caused by the
       collapse of the human immune system.
