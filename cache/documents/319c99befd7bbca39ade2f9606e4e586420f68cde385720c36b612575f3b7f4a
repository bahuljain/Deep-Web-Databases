   [118]The SkyWalker ‚Ñ¢ # 18
   Best Answer:  I think maybe around 6' 5" to 6' 6" is the average height
   of the NBA Player
   BQ: The Shortest was Muggsy Bogues at 5' 3" while the Tallest was
   George Muresan at 7' 7"
   The current shortest are Nate Robinson and Isaiah Thomas both at 5' 9"
   and the current tallestis Hasheem Thabeet at 7' 3"
   G0t it? Go0d!!!

       The current shortest is a tie between Nate Robinson and Isiah
       Thomas at 5'9. The tallest is Hasheem Thabeet at 7'3.
       The average is just a guess, but Im pretty confident it's close to
       6'6-6'7.
