   Best Answer:  That was actually a real game and it's called Snaps.

   Sorry I can't help you with the other question. I saw the episode, but

       The first letter of a sentence with "the game" in it starts a hint
       at the person(consonants only). the snaps represent vowels, 1=a,
       2=e, 3=i, 4=o, 5=u. For example, Drew Brees; Some people say he s
       the best at THE GAME an S, one snap, an a, three snaps, an i,
       Nobody thought THE GAME would pass him by, an N, and so on.
