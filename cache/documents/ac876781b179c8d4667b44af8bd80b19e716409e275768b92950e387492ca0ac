Do fat people have muscle?

   You know how those completely skinny kids how their arms look like
   sticks. For a fat person, is it the same underneath all their blubber
   or do fat people have big muscles?

   Best Answer:  even though they might not be aerobically/anaerobically
   fit, they actually have a lot of muscle to support their weight and
   everything.

       It depends on the person. Some people will have muscle under and
       some won't. If they work out, then they will most likely have some
       muscle underneath. Also everyone has muscle over their bones, just
       different amounts.

       Yes, often they do. When people gain weight from poor lifestyle
       habits, there is an increase in lean tissue as well as body fat.
       Although because body fat is the main cause of the weight gain, the
       added lean tissue is hidden by the extra layers of body fat.

       It depends on how athletic a person is, but generally a fat person
       would have more muscle because they need more muscle to get around
       etc. I'm pretty heavy, and my leg muscles are really defined.

       well that depends on the person
       some people are fat and do not have a lot of muscle mass and
       eventually end up in wheelchairs and assisted mobility of the same
       sort because they are to fat for their bones to support.
       other people have medical conditions that cause them to gain weight
       whether they are active or not. a lot of people that are fat still
       get exercise or work out and therefore have a lot of muscle as
       well.

       "Fat people" vary. Some have a lot of muscle, more than some skinny

       Everyone has muscles in their bodys! Some peoples muscles are
       larger than others, do to exercise. And you shouldn't use the terms
       blubber, and fat people, You could hurt someones feelings. They are
       refered to as over weight people, and yes they have muscles to!

       If a person has muscle like heavy muscle... that person can't be
       called as fat person...he's called as body builder... when skinny
       person seems have arms like as u told, their muscle is seen clearly
       because they won't have fat tissue... body builders, sports players
       have fat tissues a little bit since they require not only stamina
       but also recovering power...
       So above all, coming to ur topic... Fat people don't have muscle,
       they have excessive fat tissues which looks like muscle...!! OK
