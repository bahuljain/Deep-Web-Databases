Can Acupuncture Lower Your Blood Pressure?

   HealthDay Reporter

   WEDNESDAY, Sept. 2, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Can acupuncture benefit
   people with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure?

   Perhaps, a small study suggests, but the researchers behind the trial
   acknowledge that it’s too soon to say for sure.

   The researchers found that blood pressure levels declined slightly in a
   small group of patients treated 30 minutes a week with
   “electroacupuncture” — where the needles carry low-level electrical
   stimulation — at specific points of the body.

   “Potentially, blood pressure can be kept low with a monthly follow-up
   treatment,” said study co-author Dr. John Longhurst, a cardiologist at
   the University of California, Irvine.

   An estimated 70 million U.S. adults — one in three — have high blood
   pressure, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention. It’s believed that only half have their condition under
   control. High blood pressure can lead to stroke and heart disease.

   Blood pressure can often be lowered by becoming more fit, taking
   medications or both. But these approaches don’t work for everyone, and
   medication can cause side effects, especially among the elderly.

   Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese therapy, is increasingly viewed as a
   possible alternative, the researchers said in background notes with the
   study. Practitioners insert thin needles into key points on the body in
   an attempt to rebalance the flow of energy.

   Because previous studies on acupuncture’s effect on high blood pressure
   have had mixed results, the researchers set out to explore the subject
   more thoroughly. They compared electroacupuncture at two sets of points
   in their study of 65 high blood pressure patients.

   High blood pressure was defined as 140-180 mm Hg over 90-99 mm Hg. None
   of the participants was taking blood pressure medication.

   Normal blood pressure is defined as 119/79 or lower, according to the
   U.S. Institutes of Health.

   Patients were randomly assigned to one of two types of acupuncture for
   eight weeks. One type targeted the inner wrists and legs below the knee
   — points shown to potentially lower blood pressure in previous
   research. The other technique involved the forearm and lower leg and
   resulted in no blood pressure improvement, the researchers said.

   “A noticeable drop in blood pressure was observed in 70 percent of the
   patients treated at the effective points, an average of 6 to 8 mm Hg
   for systolic blood pressure [the top number] and 4 mm Hg for diastolic
   blood pressure [the lower number],” Longhurst said.

   These changes were considered slow and long-lasting — persisting for
   about six weeks, the study found.

   The researchers also found that blood pressure readings dipped further
   in a group of “high responders” that underwent monthly treatment for
   six more months.

   Exactly how acupuncture might improve blood pressure isn’t clear.
   Longhurst said it’s possible that stimulation of the affected nerves
   stimulates areas of the brain that control blood pressure.

   In some cases, he said, insurance might cover the alternative
   treatment, which can cost $60 to $120 per visit.

   Longhurst acknowledged that the research doesn’t address whether
   acupuncture could help patients already taking blood pressure
   medication.

   Dr. Randall Zusman, director of the division of hypertension at
   Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, said the study leaves
   several questions unanswered.

   Zusman said the study doesn’t include enough information about the
   participants and their blood pressure history. It’s not clear, for
   example, how recently they took medication, if they did. And he thought
   the variation in blood pressure among participants was too great. A
   smaller range would have provided more useful results, said Zusman, who
   has studied acupuncture.

   Still, “the outcomes are interesting and exciting,” he said, “and I’m
   encouraged that it might have been effective.”

   So what should you do if you have high blood pressure?

   Zusman said consider modifying your lifestyle, using medication and
   trying strategies such as relaxation training. Acupuncture is a
   low-risk procedure, and it could be useful, too, he said.

   Longhurst said further studies on acupuncture’s potential for high
   blood pressure are warranted. But, no additional research is planned,
   he said, because it’s difficult to find funding.

   The study was published recently in the journal Medical Acupuncture.
