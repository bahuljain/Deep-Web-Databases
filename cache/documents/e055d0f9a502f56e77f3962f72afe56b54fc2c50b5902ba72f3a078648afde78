NOVEL THERAPEUTICS MAY LOWER LDL IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA

   Familial combined hyperlipidemia is a highly atherogenic disorder that
   affects 1% to 2% of the Western world [Shoulders CC et al. Hum Mol
   Genet 2004]. It occurs in approximately 20% of patients who develop
   coronary heart disease before age 60 [Aouizerat BE et al. Am J Hum
   Genet 1999].

   Patrick M. Moriarty, MD, University of Kansas Medical Center, Lawrence,
   Kansas, USA, explained that treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia
   (FH) represents an unmet medical need. Statins have been shown to
   improve survival and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in
   heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) [Versmissen J et al.
   BMJ 2008] and prolong survival in homozygous familial
   hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) [Raal FJ et al. Circulation 2011]. Emerging
   therapies include apolipoprotein B (ApoB) inhibitors, microsomal
   triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, and proprotein
   convertase subtilism kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors [Alonso R et al. Expert
   Rev Cardiovasc Ther 2013].

   Mipomersen, an Injectable Apolipoprotein B-100 Inhibitor

    John J.P. Kastelein, MD, PhD, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The
   Netherlands, spoke about the benefits of mipomersen, a 20-mer
   phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide that is complementary in
   sequence to a segment of the human ApoB mRNA [Kastelein JJ et al.
   Circulation 2006]. Mipomersen is administered as a subcutaneous
   injection and has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL-C), apoB, total cholesterol, and non-high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels in patients with HoFH,
   heterozygous FH as well as high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients. It
   has been developed as an adjunct to standard therapies including a
   statin; however, its indication was limited by regulatory authorities
   due to its many side effects, including liver enzyme abnormalities and
   accumulation of fat in the liver [Raal FJ et al. Lancet 2010; Stein EA
   et al. Circulation 2012].

   In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo controlled, Phase 3
   study in which 34 HoFH patients who were already receiving the maximum
   tolerated dose of a lipid-lowering drug were randomly assigned to
   mipomersen 200 mg subcutaneously every week or placebo for 26 weeks,
   the mean percent change in LDL-C concentration was significantly
   greater with the addition of mipomersen (−24.7%; 95% CI, −31.6 to
   −17.7) compared with placebo (−3.3%; 95% CI, −12.1 to 5.5; p=0.0003)
   [Raal FJ et al. Lancet 2010].

   Lomitapide , an Oral MicrosomalTransfer Protein Inhibitor

    Michael Davidson, MD, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA,
   discussed the oral MTP inhibitor, lomitapide. MTP, an intracellular
   lipid-transfer protein found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum,
   is responsible for binding and shuttling individual lipid molecules
   between membranes [Hussain MM et al. J Lipid Res 2003]. Normal
   concentrations and function of MTP are necessary for the proper
   assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the liver and
   intestines [Liao W et al. J Lipid Res 2003].

   A dose-escalation study to examine the safety, tolerability, and
   effects on lipid levels of lomitapide (BMS-201038), an inhibitor of the
   miscrosomal triglyceride transfer protein, showed that all patients
   tolerated titration to the highest dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day. Treatment at
   this dose decreased LDL-C levels by 51% and apoB levels by 56% from
   baseline (p<0.001 for both comparisons) [Cuchel M et al. N Engl J Med
   2007]. Serious adverse effects associated with lomitapide included
   hepatic fat accumulation and elevated liver aminotransferase levels.
   Thus as with mipomersen, lomitapide has received FDA approval for use
   only in patients with HoFH due to adverse events which include
   elevations in serum transaminase and hepatic steatosis and
   gastrointestinal side effects [Robinson JG. J Manag Care Pharm 2013].

   Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibitors

    Christopher Cannon, MD, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts,
   USA, discussed the oral CETP inhibitors. The ILLUMINATE trial studied
   torcetrapib, and, in spite of favorable effects on lipids including a
   72% increase in HDL and a 25% reduction in LDL-C, was stopped early due
   to increased major cardiovascular (CV) events and higher blood pressure
   ILLUMINATE; Barter PJ et al. N Engl J Med 2007]. Later studies
   suggested that the adverse effects of torcetrapib came from
   molecule-specific off-target effects on the adrenal gland, and were not
   related to the direct effect of CETP inhibition [Krishna R et al.
   Lancet 2007].

   Dalcetrapib, the second CETP inhibitor developed, was evaluated in the
   dal-OUTCOMES trial in patients (n=15,871) with a recent acute coronary
   syndrome. A substantial increase in HDL levels was seen with
   dalcetrapib compared with placebo (31% to 40% vs 4% to 11%), and no
   off-target effects on the adrenal gland or hypertension were observed.
   However, dalcetrapib did not reduce the primary composite outcome of
   death from coronary heart disease, a major nonfatal coronary event or
   ischemic stroke (8.3% with dalcetrapib vs 8.0% with placebo; HR, 1.04;
   95% CI, 0.93 to 1.16; p=0.52) [Schwartz GG et al. N Engl J Med 2012].

   Anacetrapib is the third CETP inhibitor. It increases HDL-C by over
   100% and lowers LDL-C by 30% to 40% as monotherapy and when
   coadministered with statins [Cannon CP et al. N Engl J Med 2010]. In a
   recent 1.5-year safety study in ~1600 patients with CV disease [Cannon
   CP et al. N Engl J Med 2010], anacetrapib treatment had no effect on
   blood pressure, electrolytes, or aldosterone, and the distribution of
   CV events suggested that anacetrapib treatment would not be associated
   with an increase of CV risk as was seen with torcetrapib.

   A randomized controlled trial in 398 patients with elevated LDL-C or
   low HDL-C of a fourth CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, showed that
   evacetrapib monotherapy produced dose-dependent increases in HDL-C of
   54% to 129% and decreases in LDL-C of −14% to −36% (both p<0.001
   compared with placebo) [Nicholls SJ et al. JAMA 2011].


   Both anacetrapib and evacetrapib are currently involved in ongoing
   Phase 3 trials.

   Proprotein Convertase Subtilism Kexin 9 Inhibitors

   James M. McKenney, PharmD, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,
   Virginia, USA, discussed PCSK9 inhibitors, a novel therapy for lowering
   LDL-C. PCSK9 regulates cholesterol and/or lipid homeostasis via
   cleavage at nonbasic residues or through induced degeneration of
   receptors. Reduction in LDL-C levels with PCSK9 is associated with a
   substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary events, even in
   populations with a high prevalence of non–lipid-related CV risk factors
   [Cohen JC et al. N Engl J Med 2006].

   In the LAPLACE-TIMI 57 Phase 2, multicenter, dose-ranging study, 631
   stable patients with hypercholesterolemia on a statin, were randomly
   assignedto AMG 145, a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody against
   PCSK9, administered subcutaneously every 2 (70, 105, or 150 mg) or 4
   weeks (280, 350, or 420 mg) or matching placebo injections [Giugliano
   RP et al. Lancet 2012]. At the end of the 12-week period, largely
   dosedependent reductions in the mean LDL-C concentrations for the every
   2-week regimens ranged from 42% to 66% and from 42% to 50% for the
   every 4-week regimens (p<0.0001 for each dose vs placebo). These
   results suggest that PCSK9 inhibition could be a new model in lipid
   management and is being evaluated in ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.

   SAR236553/REGN727, another injectable monoclonal antibody to PCSK9,
   also showed promising results in a multicenter, randomized,
   placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in adults with HeFH and LDL-C
   concentrations of 100 mg/dL or higher on stable diet and statin dose,
   with or without ezetimibe. Patients were randomized to receive
   subcutaneous REGN727 150, 200, or 300 mg every 4 weeks, or 150 mg every
   2 weeks, or matching placebo every 2 weeks (ratio 1:1:1:1:1). The
   primary endpoint of LDL-C reduction from baseline to Week 12 was 29%
   for 150 mg every 4 weeks (p=0.0113), 32% for 200 g every 4 weeks
   (p=0.0035), 43% for 300 mg every 4 weeks (p<0.0001), and 68% for 150 mg
   every 2 weeks (p<0.0001), compared with 11% with placebo. [Stein EA et
   al. Lancet 2012]. A Phase 3 trial is underway to evaluate the CV
   effects and long-term safety of this compound on a background of statin
   therapy.

   Until recently, many patients with HeFH and HoFH had difficultly
   achieving adequate reduction in LDL-C. Mipomersen and lomitapide have
   recently received FDA approval for the treatment of HoFH and offer new
   options as adjuncts to high-dose statins and secondline treatments. As
   emerging therapies such as CETP inhibitors and PCSK9 inhibitors
   continue development, options will increase for patients with HoFH,
   HeFH, and other patients with severe dyslipidemia.

2013 CANADIAN HYPERTENSION EDUCATION PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS

   With the 2013 Joint National Committee Guidelines for the Management of
   High Blood Pressure (BP) in adults still under revision and not
   available for discussion, Suzanne Oparil, MD, University of Alabama at
   Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA, discussed new and important
   recommendations from the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP)
   [Daskalopoulou SS et al. Can J Cardiol 2012].

   In the last few years, out-of-office (home) BP measurement has assumed
   a more prominent role in the diagnosis and follow-up of hypertensive
   patients, in part because it may help to identify "white coat” or
   "masked” hypertension. Differentiation is important because those with
   masked hypertension have a higher rate of cardiovascular events
   compared with patients who are normotensive or have white coat
   hypertension. Previously, patients who were found to have normal BP at
   home (ie, <135/85 mm Hg) but elevated readings in the office were
   recommended for 24-hour ambulatory monitoring to confirm white coat
   hypertension. The Task Force has now added repeat home BP monitoring as
   another method to confirm white coat hypertension in such patients.

   The Task Force also made an important modification to the management
   recommendations for patients with hypertension associated with
   nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. After a comprehensive reassessment
   of the evidence examining BP targets in this patient population, it
   concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a target of
   130/80 mm Hg. Therefore, the target BP in this patient population was
   changed to <140/90 mm Hg, similar to the general population.


   The summary of evidence from CHEP for patients with diabetes and
   hypertension suggest lowering systolic BP to <140 mm Hg to reduce
   all-cause mortality and stroke, with systolic BPs <135-130 mm Hg
   appearing to confer significant additional benefits with respect to
   stroke.

   Although the risk of serious adverse events increases with BPs <140 mm
   Hg, the absolute number of these risk events is low, and therefore, the
   <130/80 mm Hg BP target in patients with diabetes remained unchanged in
   the current CHEP recommendations.

   Monotherapy is often not enough [Cushman WC et al. J Clin Hypertens
   (Greenwich) 2002], especially for patients with diabetes, and
   therefore, many hypertensive patients now receive ≥2 antihypertensive
   agents. According to the Task Force, using single pill combinations may
   help to achieve BP control by improving medication compliance. Another
   way to improve patient compliance with BP treatment is to start an
   ongoing counseling to discuss and assess coronary risk (Figure 1)
   [Grover SA et al. J Gen Intern Med 2009].

   Figure 1. Impact of Discussing Coronary Risk With Hypertensive Patients


   The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) 2013 edition of Standards of
   Medical Care in Diabetes recommends that individuals with diabetes and
   hypertension be treated to a systolic BP goal of <140 mm Hg consistent
   with the CHEP guidelines [ADA Diabetes Care2013]. In contrast, however,
   they note that some lower targets for specific patients and for
   diastolic BP including a systolic BP target of <130 mm Hg may for
   certain individuals (eg, younger patients) if it can be achieved
   without unnecessary treatment burden and target diastolic BP for
   diabetic patients of <80 mm Hg. Patients with BP >120/80 mm Hg should
   be persuaded to make lifestyle changes, while those with BP ≥140/80 mm
   Hg should begin treatment with ³1 pharmacological agents (either an
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor
   blocker) plus lifestyle therapy to achieve BP goals. Finally, for
   pregnant patient with diabetes and chronic hypertension, the ADA
   suggests BP target goals of 110/65 to 129/79 mm Hg in the interest of
   long-term maternal health and to minimize impaired fetal growth.

CHRONIC CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: GUIDELINE UPDATE

   Stephan D. Fihn, MD, MPH, University of Washington, Seattle,
   Washington, USA, discussed the current management of patients with
   chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) by highlighting key concepts from
   the 2012 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With
   Stable Ischemic Heart Disease [Fihn SD et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2012].
   The guidelines include detailed algorithms for diagnosis, risk
   assessment, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and
   revascularization to improve symptoms.

   The key concepts from the guideline include the following:


     * Management of stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) should be based
       on strong scientific evidence and patient preference.
     * Patients presenting with angina should be categorized as stable
       versus unstable. Those at moderate or high risk should be treated
       emergently for acute coronary syndrome.
     * A standard exercise test is the first choice to diagnose IHD for
       patients with an interpretable electrocardiogram (ECG) and the
       ability to exercise, especially if the likelihood is intermediate
       (10% to 90%).
     * Those who have an uninterpretable ECG and are able to exercise
       should undergo an exercise stress test with nuclear myocardial
       perfusion imaging (MPI) or echocardiography, particularly if
       likelihood of IHD is >10%. If unable to exercise, MPI or
       echocardiography with pharmacologic stress is recommended.
     * Patients diagnosed with SIHD should undergo assessment of risk for
       death or complications.
     * For patients with an interpretable ECG and who the ability to
       exercise, a standard exercise test is also the preferred choice for
       risk assessment. Those who have an uninterpretable ECG and are able
       to exercise should undergo an exercise stress with nuclear MPI or
       echocardiography, while for those patients unable to exercise, a
       nuclear MPI or echocardiography with pharmacologic stress is
       recommended.
     * Patients with SIHD should generally receive a "package” of GDMT
       that includes lifestyle interventions and medications shown to
       improve outcomes. This includes the following (as appropriate):
       Diet, weight loss, and regular physical activity; if a smoker,
       smoking cessation; aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily; a statin medication
       in moderate dosage; if hypertensive, antihypertensive medication to
       achieve a blood pressure (BP) <140/90 mm Hg; and »» if diabetic,
       appropriate glycemic control.
     * Patients with angina should receive sublingual nitroglycerin and a
       b-blocker. When these are not tolerated or are ineffective, a
       calcium-channel blocker or long-acting nitrate may be substituted
       or added.
     * Coronary arteriography should be considered for patients with SIHD
       whose clinical characteristics and results of noninvasive testing
       indicate a high likelihood of severe IHD and when the benefits are
       deemed to exceed risk.
     * The relatively small proportion of patients who have "high-risk”
       anatomy (eg, >50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery),
       revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting should be
       considered to potentially improve survival. Most data showing
       improved survival with surgery compared with medical therapy are
       several decades old and based on surgical techniques and medical
       therapies that have advanced considerably. There are no conclusive
       data demonstrating improved survival following percutaneous
       coronary intervention.
     * Most patients should have a trial of GDMT before considering
       revascularization to improve symptoms. Deferring revascularization
       is not associated with worse outcomes.
     * Prior to revascularization to improve symptoms, coronary anatomy
       should be correlated with functional studies to ensure lesions
       responsible for symptoms are targeted.
     * Patients with SIHD should be carefully followed to monitor
       progression of disease, complications, and adherence (Table 1).
       Exercise and imaging studies should generally be repeated only when
       there is a change in clinical status (not annually).

   The Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), the
   American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and the American
   Society of Hypertension (ASH) on the Treatment of Hypertension in the
   Prevention and Management of Ischemic Heart Disease is expected for
   publication later this year (2013). A prepublication embargo prevented
   discussion at this year’s annual ACC meeting. Suzanne Oparil, MD,
   University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA,
   suggested that the 2011 Performance Measures for Adults With Coronary
   Artery Disease and Hypertension [Drozda J Jr et al. J Am Coll Cardiol
   2011] could provide some insight into the direction of the new
   guidelines. Specifically, she noted that the 2011 measures go beyond
   targeting established BP goals. The goal of antihypertensive treatment
   in patients with CAD or at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was
   defined as <140/90 mm Hg. The rationale behind this change from a prior
   goal of <130/80 mm Hg was that some clinical trials in which specific
   antihypertensive drug therapies were given to individuals with CAD or
   high CVD risk who had BP <140/90 mm Hg showed benefit, but others had
   negative or equivocal findings. This heterogeneity in the published
   literature was used to justify a less strict (<140/90 mm Hg) BP goal in
   the performance measures. While the authors acknowledge that lower BP
   targets may be appropriate for some patients with CAD or other
   conditions, it is unclear how such patients could be reliably
   identified for purposes of performance measurement. In Dr. Oparil’s
   opinion, the strongest evidence in support of the concept that "lower
   is not better” is the ACCORD trial, which showed no benefit from
   intensive (<120 mm Hg) versus standard (<140 mm Hg) BP control in terms
   of fatal and nonfatal major CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes
   at high risk for CV events [ACCORD Study Group. N Engl J Med 2010].
   Subanalyses and post hoc reports from the INVEST [Cooper-DeHoff RM et
   al. JAMA2010] and ONTARGET trials [Mancia G et al. Circulation 2011]
   provide similar findings. Although the Systolic Blood Pressure
   Intervention Trial [SPRINT; NCT01206062] will likely not end until 2016
   or later. Dr. Oparil said the results are highly anticipated as it is
   designed to assess the effects of intensive BP lowering (<120 vs <140
   mm Hg) on major CV events in patients without diabetes but with CVD
   risk factors, including chronic kidney disease, clinical CVD (excluding
   stroke), and age >75 years.


   As with the 8th report on the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
   Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC8), the
   Guidelines for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults – JNC
   2013, the new guidelines for treating lipids in patients at risk for
   CVD (Adult Treatment Panel; ATP IV) are also still in development. In
   lieu of a discussion of the guidelines, Jennifer G. Robinson, MD, MPH,
   University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA, discussed new evidence
   published since the committee completed their work and some of the
   evidence considered in the development of the guidelines. Of recent
   interest are the results of a meta-analysis of 27 primary and secondary
   prevention trials (n=134,537 participants) that evaluated the effects
   of using statins to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
   in individuals at low risk of CVD [Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’
   Collaborators.Lancet 2012]. A key finding of the study was that for
   individuals with a 5-year risk of major vascular events of <10% (a
   population of patients not typically considered suitable for statin
   therapy), each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C produced an absolute
   reduction in major vascular events of approximately 1.1%. In
   particular, those patients without a history of vascular disease and a
   5% to <10% 5-year major CVD risk experienced a significant reduction
   (34%; p=0.003 for trend) in the relative risk of major CVD and a
   borderline significant 17% reduction in total mortality compared with
   those in the higher risk groups (Figure 1).

   with statin therapy in people at low risk of vascular disease:
   Meta-analysis of individual data from 27 randomised trials. The Lancet
   Aug 2012;380(9841):581-590.

   The AHA recently issued a statement on triglycerides and CVD [Miller M
   et al. Circulation 2011]. Dr. Robinson briefly summarized that
   statement noting that the focus in patients with triglyceride levels
   <500 mg/dL should be on decreasing the risk for CVD through improved
   diet, increased physical activity, and weight loss, and by getting the
   patient on a statin. These patients should also be assessed for
   diabetes. Treatment is the same for patients whose triglyceride level
   is >500 mg/dL, but with the additional focus of preventing
   pancreatitis.


   This session offered some early insights into the long-awaited and
   eagerly anticipated release of the JNC-8 and ATP IV guidelines.

HIGH-DOSE ROSUVASTATIN REDUCES CONTRAST-INDUCED NEPHROPATHY

   Among statin-naïve patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute
   coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) managed with an early invasive strategy,
   pretreatment with high-dose rosuvastatin was associated with a
   significant reduction in the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney
   injury (CI-AKI). In addition, pretreatment with rosuvastatin was also
   associated with a reduction in adverse clinical events at 30 days
   compared with placebo. Anna Toso, MD, Misericordia e Dolce Hospital,
   Prato, Italy, presented the results of the Protective Effect of
   Rosuvastatin and Antiplatelet Therapy on Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney
   Injury and Myocardial Damage in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome
   study [PRATOACS; NCT01185938] on behalf of the trial investigators.

   Statins, due to their lipid-lowering and pleiotropic properties, may
   have a renal-protective effect after contrast medium administration for
   patients undergoing an angiographic procedure. However, the dose, type,
   timing and target population for statin use is uncertain. This study
   tested the hypothesis that high doses of rosuvastatin given before an
   angiographic procedure would protect against the development of CI-AKI.

   In the PRATO-ACS trial, statin-naïve NSTE-ACS patients admitted to the
   cardiac care unit (CCU) between July 2010 and August 2012 managed with
   an early invasive strategy were eligible for the study. Exclusion
   criteria were: emergent angiography, acute renal failure or early-stage
   renal disease requiring dialysis, a baseline serum creatinine ≥3 mg/dL,
   contraindications to statin treatment, or exposure to contrast medium
   within the last 10 days. After admission to the CCU, 271 patients were
   randomized to receive rosuvastatin (loading dose of 40 mg, then 20
   mg/day) or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the development of
   CI-AKI defined as a rise in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL absolute or
   ≥25% increase relative to baseline that occurred within 72 hours of
   contrast exposure.

   Serum creatinine increases ≥25%, ≥0.5 mg/dL, and ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48
   and 72 hours, as well as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration
   rate ≥25% within 72 hours were additional biomarker endpoints. Other
   clinical endpoints included acute renal failure requiring dialysis,
   persistent renal damage, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction,
   and stroke through 30 days.

   All patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy
   (aspirin+clopidogrel) prior to coronary angiography (±percutaneous
   coronary intervention) and after discharge. In addition, all patients
   received oral N-acetylcysteine and hydration both pre- and 24 hours
   post contrast medium (nonionic, dimeric isoosmolar) administration.
   CI-AKI analysis was performed in 252 patients in each group after 72
   hours. At discharge patients in the rosuvastatin pretreatment group
   continued rosuvastatin 20 mg, while those in control group received
   atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

   There were no significant differences in baseline clinical,
   biochemical, or demographic characteristic, time from randomization to
   angiography, procedural success, or CI-AKI Mehran risk score, a
   validated risk prediction model for the development of CI-AKI, between
   the 2 groups.

   CI-AKI was significantly less frequent in patients pretreated with
   rosuvastatin compared with placebo (6.7% vs 15.1%; adjusted OR, 0.38;
   95% CI, 0.20 to 0.71; p=0.001; Figure 1). Compared with placebo,
   pretreatment with rosuvastatin was associated with significant
   reductions in all of the CI-AKI endpoints and the effect was consistent
   across all prespecified subgroups.

   In addition, rosuvastatin pretreatment reduced the rate of acute renal
   failure requiring dialysis, persistent renal damage, all-cause
   mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke at 30 days (3.6% vs 7.9%;
   p=0.036) compared with placebo (Figure 2).

   To date, there have been few effective strategies to protect patients
   from developing CI-AKI. The findings from the PRATO-ACS trial are
   notable and further studies are needed to both corroborate these
   results and potentially evaluate whether this is a class-effect of
   statins or unique to rosuvastatin.

RANOLAZINE PROVIDES BENEFIT OVER PLACEBO FOR T2DM PATIENTS WITH ANGINA

   In a trial focused on the treatment of stable angina in patients with
   type 2 diabetes (T2DM), ranolazine significantly reduced the frequency
   of angina episodes compared with placebo. Mikhail Kosiborod, MD, St.
   Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, Missouri, USA,
   presented the results of the Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine
   in Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina study [TERISA; Kosiborod M et
   al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2013].

   The primary objective of the randomized double-blind TERISA study was
   to evaluate the efficacy of ranolazine versus placebo on angina
   frequency in T2DM patients with coronary artery disease and chronic
   stable angina who were also taking 1 or 2 antianginal medications (eg,
   b-blockers). The primary endpoint was the average weekly number of
   angina episodes from Week 2 to Week 8 of treatment, while secondary
   endpoints included the average weekly number of sublingual
   nitroglycerin (SL NTG) doses from Week 2 to Week 8.

   The trial enrolled 949 patients at 104 sites in Europe, Asia, and North
   America. Following a 4-week single-blind baseline-setting placebo
   period, patients (mean age 64 years) were randomized to receive
   ranolazine 1000 mg BID (n=473) or placebo (n=476) for 8 weeks. Eleven
   patients in each arm that either initiated or discontinued the study
   drug during the first 2 weeks were excluded from the final analysis.
   Researchers received daily data transmissions from patients who
   recorded angina episodes and SL NTG use in handheld electronic device
   diaries (98% compliance). Researchers followed-up with a phone call 2
   weeks after the end of the 8-week period. Randomized patients were
   mostly male (61%) and had a mean diabetes duration of 7.5 years and a
   mean baseline HbA1C of 7.3%.

   For the primary endpoint, patients in the ranolazine group experienced
   significantly fewer average weekly angina episodes from Week 2 to Week
   8 than patients in the placebo group (3.8 vs 4.3,; p=0.008; Figure 1).
   Furthermore, patients in the ranolazine group took fewer average weekly
   SL NTG doses from Week 2 to Week 8 than those in the placebo group (1.7
   vs 2.1, respectively; p=0.003; Figure 2). There were few serious
   adverse events, with no significant difference between the 2 groups.

   from Elsevier.

   It should be noted that generalizability of these results may be
   limited due to the lack of racial diversity of the study population. In
   addition, the short follow-up limits conclusions about the durability
   of therapy. Significant geographic heterogeneity was seen in treatment
   effect (p for interaction=0.016) with an apparent attenuation of
   benefit in selected Eastern European countries. Dr. Kosiborod said that
   an investigation is currently ongoing to determine the reason for this
   lack of an effect in these patients. In another subgroup analysis, the
   overall benefit with ranolazine versus placebo was more pronounced in
   patients with higher baseline HbA1C levels (p for interaction=0.027);
   however, measurement was not taken on follow-up for possible
   comparison.

   In conclusion, TERISA showed that ranolazine was more effective than
   placebo in reducing angina frequency in T2DM patients with coronary
   artery disease and chronic stable angina. Future studies may shed light
   on potential dual effects of ranolazine on angina and glucose control
   in T2DM patients.
