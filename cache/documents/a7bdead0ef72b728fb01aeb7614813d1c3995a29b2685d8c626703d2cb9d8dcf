   So, just before all the stuff with my cousins and aunt and uncle
   happened, we got a phone call from my brother in Hawai'i! Besides
   normal family talk, he told us he has lost 30 lbs. Being over 40,
   having a sister and a mom with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
   (respectively), and having had weight problems for quite a while, he
   knows he needs to get his weight down and keep it down. Last time he
   lost weight, he used the Atkins diet with outstanding results: He was
   as trim as he was when he was active duty in the military. He tried it
   again, but this time, he has not had as much success and a problem has
   cropped up. This time, during his "induction" phase, as he was eating
   pounds of meat as his meals, he noticed he was developing some pain in
   his feet. It got worse as time went on, until he found he could barely
   stand. His doctor has diagnosed him with gout in his foot and told him
   that it is likely the gout was caused by the diet, since the diet was
   the only thing that has changed.


   Have any of you who have used the ultra-low carb diets developed gout?
   If you have, what did you do to manage the condition? Did you modify
   the diet, use drugs, or what? He's also become scared to run, as he
   still has pain and is afraid to aggravate the condition. Did you have
   to change your exercise regimen?


   Any insights are appreciated!

   Angela,


   Developing gout from a low carb diet is not something that anyone has
   mentioned here, even though some people who have gout have posted.


   Gout has a different set of foods that aggravate it, and your bother
   would do well to look up the diet for gout on the web if his doctor ahs
   not provided that information. It is different than the diet for
   diabetes, and people with both have a problem balancing the dietary
   needs of 2 different conditions. Waht is left for them to eat?  Kind of
   like people with celiac disease and diabetes do, or people who choose
   to be vegan and then have diabetes.


   Fortunately though, unless you just didn't mention it, your brother
   doesn't have diabetes, so he should be able to adopt a diet adapted for
   gout, and should be able to reduce intake enough tot also lose weight.

   Angela, my non-diabetic FIL has had gout flare ups a couple of times.
   We bought him pure cherry juice for the first time, then the second
   time he went to the Doc because of the pain( he couldn't even stand the
   sheets on his feet), they gave him a prescription .  Can't remember
   what it was but I think Rae takes it, I'll ask her to join in.

   We bought black cherry pills for Hubby when we thought he had gout but
   it turned out to be arthritis in his first joint above his big
   toe......but still very painful.


   Good luck to your Brother...........................Big

   Purely anecdotal.


   I have no gout, nor do any of the low-carbers I presently communicate
   with. The only person I know personally with gout is my brother-in-law
   and he definitely does not eat low-carb; rather the reverse.

   Angela, I have had no experience with gout but my first thought was
   that the Atkins diet would not be the best for gout.


   I googled "foods that cause gout" and got many results similar to this
   one....


   [96]http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20448674,00.html


   Certainly the large quantities of protein and fat laden foods are
   likely to build up uric acid and Atkins did advise dieters to eat all
   the meats and heavy fats that they wanted.


   Perhaps everything in moderation might be the best route to take once
   your brother is over this flare up.

   Diagnosed as type 2 in 2005 with an A1c of 9.1
   Started with metformin and a low dose of an ARB for blood pressure.
   Added a sulfonylurea (a med that helps my pancreas produce my own
   insulin) Also a low dose of Crestor to lower my cholesterol.
   After 7 years I could no longer tolerate metformin so am doing my best
   to keep control with a max dose of the sulfonylurea and lots of
   walking, some swimming.

   I have a son with gout, so this was a good review for me.


   This page from the Mayo Clinic discusses the diet for gout:
   [107]http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gout-diet/MY01137


   It's not so much the absence of carbs that would cause a problem, as an
   excess of meat. Meat, as it is digested, is a source of uric acid, and
   it is the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints that causes
   pain and damage. A high protein diet is definitely not a good strategy
   for weight loss with diabetes.

   Hi there Angela,


   I am a diabetic AND I have gout too (lucky me uh? LOL). Gout runs like
   wildfire in my family, together with diabetes...


   Gout is not exactly alike for everyone. Some people are more sensitive
   to certain things than others. For example, I am very sensitive to
   tomatoes: if I eat a medium sized tomato a day for 3-4 days, I know I
   will have a flare up (mine hits me in the right hand. At the base of
   the thumb. My last flare up was about 3 weeks ago. I had been flare up
   free for a couple of years...), however of medium intensity. I am less
   sensitive to most other things that are notable culprits for flare ups,
   like red meat.


   As far as I am concerned, to control gout I just need to not over
   indulge in foods that can cause flare ups. Having a varied diet should
   be enough for most, it is for sure for me.

   My suggestion to your cousin is to vary his diet as much as possible,
   alternating "safe" food with food that is not that good for the
   disease. For example, eat red meat every 3-4 days or so, instead of
   every day. When not eating that, eat chicken/turkey or some other form
   protein not obtained via red meat.

   Note though that if he's THAT bad at the moment, I'd suggest for him to
   just cut out red meat for 2-3 weeks and then reintroduce it gradually.
   That's what I would do if I was in his shoes. What I wrote is thru
   personal experience, I am no doctor, but I can tell you that the first
   time that gout showed up in me, parachute pants were the rage. So it's
   quite a while ago and I have managed it very well since... Smiley Happy


   PS: ok here's a little further insight...Years ago I put on my fridge a
   magnetic board on which I wrote the food that I need to be cautious
   (=not to be eaten in large quantities) re. gout and here are the foods
   that in MY case are more susceptible to cause my gout to flare up:
   tomatoes (these, as I said, are killers for me, more than anything
   else), alcohol beverages, red meat, butter, fruit in general,
   jams+marmalades, peas+beans, crustaceans.

   I have gout and diabetes 2. Both are in the hereditary category. I have
   used the black cherry capsules to help with the pain. There are several
   meds available however my doc will not give them to me as they can
   cause wear and tear on the kidneys along with the diabetes.


   He does need to be tested to determine if it is gout. Uric acid build
   up in the body is the culprit and a level above 6 will determine if it
   is indeed gout or arthritis. The uric acid is a natural antioxidant in
   the body but the level can be increased by certain foods, organ meats
   being the highest instigator. I doubt very seriously if the low carb
   diet is the cause of his flare ups. At lot has to do with age. Being 40
   and over, changes in the body will most likely start to take place.

   My FIL has gout flare ups from time to time and is pre-diabetic.  For
   him it is red meat that causes the flares.  It seems that most people
   just have to find out what foods cause their flare-ups and avoid those
   foods
