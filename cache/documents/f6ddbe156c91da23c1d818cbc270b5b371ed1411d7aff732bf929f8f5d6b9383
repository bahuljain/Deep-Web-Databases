Medical treatment?

   for christians: would you refuse medical treatment from a dr who you
   knew was an atheist?
   Update: I asked because I heard a lady say one day that she would never
   let a non believer operate on her..as she needed to know that the dr
   was praying for God to guide his hands.

       Silly people make a mockery of their religion, If you are aching
       and in pain and faith is nowhere to be found, then be all means see
       a practitioner or doctor...
       Should you be blessed with such surreal and sublime peace and
       belief in your Supreme Spirit and his power then you will rarely
       fall ill, barring accidental cuts or wounds which may require
       medical attention ...
       The religion of the surgeon should not be a matter of concern. It
       is invariably these dogmatic zealots who bring defamation upon
       religion and the religious ...

       As a christian with no medical insurance, I would happily let a
       qualified atheist fix my sore elbow. Then I would that person about
       Gods love, and Jesus' sacrifice. I'd do the same with insurance too
       :)

       I could care less what his faith is. If he/she is an accomplished
       physician thats all I worry about. If I am sick enough to go to the
       doctor in the first place I won't refuse treatment from a non
       believer.

       Nope - the religious affliation or lack thereof of a doctor would
       not impact my choice. I want a doctor who knows what he/she is
       doing and is good at their job. If they are atheist - so be it.
       Unless they tried to put me into a mental health center because I
       am religious, their atheism wouldn't bother me.
       Peace!

       Medical Treatment?
       That's too practical for a christian. Don't they just clasp their
       hands together and mumble to their friend in the sky?

       Christians don't need Doctors dear. They can talk silently in their
       head to their invisible friend in the sky and then they get treated
       miraculously. Only those that are faking their faith seek medical
       help....

       you would think if you needed treatment you wouldn't have time to
