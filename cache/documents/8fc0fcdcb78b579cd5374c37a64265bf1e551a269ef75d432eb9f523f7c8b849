   Our new school nurse kept my son in her office for an hour today and an
   hour yesterday. She wanted to send him home. He did have high numbers,
   but what the heck? Give him some insulin and get back to class! Am I
   wrong? He was in the low 300s and it was after lunch.

   Do you have any paperwork from his doctor telling the school what to do
   when he has high numbers?  If they aren't following it, then you have a
   case.  If you don't have a detailed Medical Management Plan, get one
   asap!  In it, the doctor (with your help) can lay out how your son is
   to be treated for highs, lows, etc..  You'll probably find the nurse
   with the attitude that if it isn't in his medical plan, then she can't
   do it as she can only follow doctor's orders.(the plan)   And you might
   want to look into getting a 504 plan in place for him also.  Those are
   harder to get as alot of schools fight the kids having one even though
   they're entittled to one per the Americans with Disabilities Act.
   Diabetes is considered a disability in how it effects kids and
   schoolwork.   It's just so many school are so not on board with
   complying with having one for their students with D.

   Hi I can't remember how old your son is or if he is on a pump or
   injections.  If he went to check his blood sugar before lunch and it
   was high, no ketones and he felt ok, the nurse should have had him
   bolus or cover for lunch and add correction and go eat and drink.  have
   him come back and check again in 2 hours.  Staying in the office is not
   going to accomplish anything.  If he felt crummy and ketones were
   present, then yes he probably needed to come home.  the first couple
   weeks of school are awful for trying to get blood sugar back on track.
   there is the stress of school, new eating and sleeping patterns,
   allergy season, you name it.  Poking the kid's finger every 15 or 20
   minutes is not going to accomplish anything for a high.  We really
   struggled with this in middle school.  our son was being held in the
   office off and on all day.  His grades suffered, he was stressed out
   and his teachers were no help.  We thought the nurse communicated to
   staff, but that was not happeneing.  Finally, unless it was a low or he
   felt crummy, we stopped blood sugar checks other than lunch.  By that
   time, his school day had become all about diabetes and not school.  We
   put the focus back on communicating with his teachers and not the
   nurse.  Now, he is 17.  Some days are good and some are not but school,
   sports etc do not stop over it.  Good luck and let us know how it turns
   out.

   I had similar issues even know I had a detailed format in which she
   should follow while my grand daughter was in school.She was newly
   diagnosed just last march,and she was the first student in that school
   with type 1 for the past 3 years.The nurse had to brush up on the
   information ,and I would get these calls that she had high B/S numbers
   and she asked me what to do,at that time I would tell her to dose her
   for it per what the sheet says,she would tell me the sheet dont specify
   how and when and how much to give her...as most of you know with
   children in school ,the sheet and medical paperwork is very precise and
   complete with all instructions that anyone in the medical field should
   be able to take care of...her answer was to sit her in the office and
   have her drink water and check her every 15 mins until she came down,I
   asked if this is the remedy then why the need for insulin to begin
   with.....I got tired of foolin with her and just would go pick my GD up
   from school beings it was the ending of the school year
   anyway......When I kooled down I had to go into the office and talk
   with the nurse and explain what exactly the med sheet was saying,she
   then understtod and I didnt really have as much problems after
   that....communication is the key here,if i couldnt communicate with GD
   school nurse and vice versa the only one suffering would be my grand
   daughter.....she has a 504 plan,matter of fact I go next wednesday to
   update it for this school year.........
