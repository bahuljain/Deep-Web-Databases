   Feeling overwhelmed can signal a depression relapse.

   For people with a history of depression or bipolar disorder, the risk
   of relapse looms like a cloud over their lives, threatening to separate
   them from their work, relationships, even their children. Stress,
   [96]sleep deprivation, hormonal shifts, and stopping treatment are
   among the most common relapse triggers.
   The National Mental Health Information Center at the U.S. Department of
   Health and Human Services lists numerous triggers. Here are five:
     * Interpersonal friction
     * Feeling overwhelmed or having too much to do
     * Being judged or criticized
     * Ending a relationship
     * Physical illness

   Sometimes the signs of dangerous stress are more subtle. Laura
   Gilmartin, 38, an office manager in Skokie, Ill., finds herself eating
   more junk food or [101]smoking more than usual. "Or if I find myself
   coming home from work and falling into bed more than two days in a row,
   that gets me scared. The more time I want to spend in bed the more I
   know I need to get out of bed."
   Delay decisions during relapse
   The temptation to stop treatment on your own is another trigger, one
   that can lead to a downward spiral. Mary, 45, of Western Massachusetts,
   almost landed in the hospital during a suicidal depressive episode when
   she decided to go cold turkey. "What happens is I begin to feel great,
   and I rationalize that less is better when it comes to medication," she
   says.
   If you are in the midst of a relapse, it's critical to realize that
   your outlook on everything is altered, and it's unlikely that you will
   be aware of your lack of perspective. "So to the extent possible,
   important decisions should be delayed," says Richard Raskin, PhD, a
   licensed psychologist in New York City.
   Lisa, 42, a real estate broker in Huntington, N.Y., has been battling
   depression for years and can now steel herself against relapses. During
   the past year, she and her husband separated, and though she felt sad,
   she used the tools she learned in therapy to keep perspective. "I
   wasn't depressed. I think that's a testament of what talk therapy and
   medication can do. Ten years ago that would have put me in the grave."
