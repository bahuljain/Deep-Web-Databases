Statins Linked to Raised Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

   March 4, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [glucose_monitor.jpg]

   By Dennis Thompson
   HealthDay Reporter

   WEDNESDAY, March 4, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Cholesterol-lowering statin
   drugs may significantly increase a person’s risk of developing type 2
   diabetes, a new study from Finland suggests.

   Researchers found that statins were associated with an almost 50
   percent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting
   for other factors.

   Statins appear to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in several ways,
   the researchers said. One is that the drugs can increase a person’s
   insulin resistance, and the other is that the cholesterol-lowering
   drugs seem to impair the ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin,
   according to the report.

   Commenting on the study, Dr. Ronald Goldberg, director of the Lipid
   Disorder Clinic and associate director of the Diabetes Research
   Institute at the University of Miami, said the researchers “show
   evidence that statins increased insulin resistance, and that the people
   who developed diabetes appeared to have less ability to respond to the
   insulin resistance by making more insulin.”

   The study authors noted, however, that their research only found an
   association between statin use and diabetes risk. And since the study
   was limited to white men, it’s not clear if the findings would apply to
   women or other racial groups.

   More than 29 million people in the United States have diabetes,
   according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Type 2 diabetes
   occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone needed to
   process the sugars found in foods. To compensate, the body produces
   more insulin. Excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle are two important
   risk factors for type 2 diabetes, according to the ADA.

   Prior studies have indicated that statins may increase a person’s risk
   of diabetes, the authors said in background information in the study.
   However, these earlier studies were focused mainly on statins’ role in
   preventing heart disease, not on their potential diabetes risk.

   In this new study, University of Eastern Finland researchers tracked
   the effects of statin treatment in almost 9,000 men without diabetes
   over the course of six years. The men were between 45 and 73 years old.
   One in four of the men was taking a statin at the beginning of the
   study.

   The health of the men was followed for nearly six years. During that
   time, 625 men were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the
   researchers said. Even after other risk factors were accounted for,
   people treated with statins were 46 percent more likely to develop
   diabetes than those not treated with statins.

   The diabetes risk increased with the dosage taken of the statin drugs
   simvastatin (Zocor) and atorvastatin (Lipitor), the researchers said.

   Digging a little deeper, the investigators found that statins decreased
   insulin sensitivity by 24 percent, and insulin secretion by 12 percent.
   The more simvastatin and atorvastatin that people took, the more their
   ability to use and produce insulin suffered.

   High-dose simvastatin was associated with a 44 percent increased risk
   of developing diabetes, while for low-dose simvastatin the increased
   risk was 28 percent. High-dose atorvastatin was linked to a 37 percent
   increased diabetes risk, the study found.

   Based on these findings, physicians will have to weigh risks versus
   benefits before prescribing statins, said Dr. Al Powers, director of
   the division of diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism at Vanderbilt
   University Medical Center.

   Patients with pre-diabetes will need particular consideration, given
   that they are already on the verge of developing type 2 diabetes,
   Powers said.

   “That’s a situation where the physician and the patient must weigh the
   risks and benefits and decide what to do,” Powers said.

   On the other hand, statins can be prescribed without concern to people
   already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, since they are already being
   treated for the condition, he added. “Those patients should continue
   their statin treatment,” Powers said.

   Goldberg expects that most heart patients who need statins will
   continue to receive them, but with close monitoring of their blood
   sugar levels.

   “If your risk for heart disease is high, the benefit of statin therapy
   is so important that most physicians and most patients, when it’s
   explained to them, will be willing to incur the increased risk of
   diabetes in favor of the added benefit to preventing heart attack and
   stroke,” Goldberg said.

   Dr. Alan Garber, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, said that
   statin users with blood sugar levels beginning to creep up can likely
   head off type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise. Garber is the
   editor of the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

   “The solution is lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. You
   should do that for high cholesterol, anyway,” Garber said. “There’s no
   simple cure-all for all the risk factors in life. It’s clear that a
   single pill isn’t going to supplant individual self-management.
   Patients have to learn to take care of themselves.”

   The findings were published March 4 in Diabetologia, the journal of the
   European Association for the Study of Diabetes.
