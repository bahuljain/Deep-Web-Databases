   [122]empty-weekly-pill-box
   The American Heart Association recently announced the biggest threat to

[124]Which Statin Will Lower Your Cholesterol?

   Even when you find one that works, it's no substitute for lifestyle

[130]Blood Pressure Medications

   Prescription options to control high blood pressure
   [131]statins-cardiogram
   High blood pressure strains the heart and damages arteries. Those
   damaged spots tend to attract clumps of plaque, the stuff that can
   cause a heart attack. What's more, vessels in the brain can even burst
