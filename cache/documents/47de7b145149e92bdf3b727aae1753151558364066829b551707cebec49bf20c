What do calories from fat mean? Do they make you fat?

   If I want to get stronger and keep fat from getting to high, do I quit
   eating foods like peanut butter? Do they make you fat, because it says
   like 180 calories and 130 from fat. Does that mean it will turn into
   fat when it gets in your body, and even if it does, to get strong do
   you need to eat it? Thanks a lot

   Best Answer:  A 'calorie' is just an amount of energy, like 'pints' of
   water, or 'miles' of distance.
   Fruit contains a lot of water, and some sugar. This can be squeezed
   out, and makes 'juice'. Nuts (all kinds) contain very little water, and
   very little sugar, but they do have oil in them. If you leave a peanut,
   or a walnut, (without its shell) on a piece of paper (plain copier
   paper, not the shiny sort) for long enough, it will leave an oily mark
   on the paper.
   When peanuts are crushed, their oil is what makes them into peanut
   butter instead of peanut powder.
   Fat (grease, oil, wax) contains energy, which can be released by
   burning it. A burning candle turns the energy in its wax into heat.
   Some of your muscle fibres use fat as fuel. They 'burn' the fat, and
   turn its energy into movement (and some heat as well, which is why
   exercising makes you warm). This fat comes from the food you eat, and
   some comes from storage ('adipose tissue') around your body. These
   fibres can ONLY make gentle movements.
   Other muscle fibres use sugar as fuel. The two fuels CANNOT be used
   interchangeably. Sugarburning fibres are the ones that make movements
   powerful.
   So, if you eat a lot of peanut butter, you gain a lot of fat that you
   can use as fuel. BUT if you exercise vigorously (using sugar as fuel)
   you will get tired and hungry, without burning much fat. The unused fat
   will be stored, instead of being burned, because you will need to stop
   exercising, eat something with some sugar in it, and wait for
   'recovery' to happen begfore you can exercise some more.
   If you are active all the time, but at a gentle pace, you won't burn as
   much sugar. That means you won't get hungry, and you won't have to stop
   and rest so soon. But it also means that you can keep on burning fat.
   This will stimulate the release of more fat from 'adipose' storage
   sites.
   If you are moving gently enough to burn ONLY fat, you can keep the
   activity up ALL THE TIME without getting fatigued and hungry (although
   you will still need to sleep at some point; that's a different kind of
   'tired').
   In reality, all activities burn some fat and some sugar, but you can
   choose whether you're burning more fat, or more sugar, according to how
   much effort you put into the movements.
   All the time you're sitting still (including recovery from vigorous
   exercise) fat is being stored. But during all of the time that you
   spend moving about, fat is being burned. The more parts of your body
   you are moving about, the more fat is being burned.
   That's why swimming is one of the best ways to control your bodyfat,
   even though it's rarely done 'aerobically' (very energetically) except
   by competitive team swimmers.
   To make your muscles stronger, you will need to do 'heavy' (vigorous)
   work, so you will burn a lot of sugar and need to spend time
   recovering.
   You can keep your bodyfat low in two different ways:
   Either eat differently, so that you take in a small amount of fat (your
   body does need some, in order to stay healthy).
   Or do a moderate amount of strength training (so that you don't need to
   spend too much time recovering), and stay (gently) active between your
   training sessions.

       The calories from fat are just the number of calories that come
       from fat. For example, if peanut butter is 180, and 130 of them
       come from fat, then the remaining 50 come from other sources. But
       just because peanut butter is high in fat, does not make it
       unhealthy. It has protein and many other important things that are
       very good for you. As long as you eat within moderation. The fact
       is, the amount of fat or sugar doesn't really matter that much, it
       is the calories that count. So eat a reasonable amount of calories
       and you will be fine. I lost a lot of weight just counting
       calories, not fat.

       The amount of calories in food is determined by the fat, protein,
       carb, and alcohol content. It is just telling you how many of the
       calories in that particular food are coming from fat. It does not
       mean it will make you fat, it is just there as an FYI mainly.

       it really depends on what kind of fat the food is. look for
       something low in saturated and trans fats because those are the
       killers. Something like olive oil which can be made with many foods
       has 14 grams of fat in a tablespoon. that may seem like a lot but
       only 1 gram is saturated so it is healthy fat. look on the
       nutrition lable and if it's low in saturated and trans fat than it
       is good fat (omega's mono-unsaturated etc.) Just make sure not to
       load up on fat. on a 2000 calorie diet you should consume 66 grams
       of fat

       A calorie is a unit of measurement for energy. In most fields, it
       has been replaced by the joule, the SI unit of energy. However, the
       kilo calorie or calorie ...
       the thing with fat is there are more calories in a gram of fat
       verse a gram of protein. but the body will burn the protein calorie
       be for the fat calorie. this is a built in survival system in our
       bodies.

       With every day pass, our country is getting into more and more
       trouble. The inflation, unemployment and falling value of dollar
       are the main concern for our Government but authorities are just
       sleeping, they don‚Äôt want to face the fact. Media is also involve
       in it, they are force to stop showing the real economic situation
       to the people. I start getting more concern about my future as well
       as my family after watching the response of our Government for the
       people that affected by hurricane Katrina.
       According to recent studies made by World Bank, the coming crisis
       will be far worse than initially predicted. So if you're already
       preparing for the crisis (or haven't started yet) make sure you
       watch this video at http://www.familysurvival.tv and discover the 4
       BIG issues you'll have to deal with when the crisis hits, and how
       to solve them fast (before the disaster strikes your town!) without
       spending $1,000s on overrated items and useless survival books.

       You cannot get rid of the dimples and shadows (cellulite) by
       rubbing an odd gel, weird lotion or goopy cream on your trouble
       zones and problem spots. I know that some can actually make your
       cellulite worse. The only proven way to permanently get rid of the
       dimples and shadows of cellulite is through a series of simple, yet
       specifically targeted lower-body movements. These unique movements
       focus on lifting, shaping and toning the muscle layers so they
       gently push outward against the skin to bring back the smooth,
       tight and sexy appearance, while burning off any excess flab, if
       there is any. Have a look to this site for more details and
       eye-opening information about cellulite
