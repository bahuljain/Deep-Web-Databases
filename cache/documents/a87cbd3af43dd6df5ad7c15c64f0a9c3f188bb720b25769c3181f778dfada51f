   (GETTYIMAGES)
   Got allergies? If you do, the Internet offers a host of helpful
   options, from widgets to iPhone applications to pollen-counting
   programs that deliver daily emails to your inbox. Used correctly, these
   digital tools can help fight allergies in the real word, experts say.
   Before you rush to sign up or download, however, you might need a bit
   of help from your doctor. He or she can determine the true culprits
   behind your sneezing, stuffy nose, and watery eyes, says Stanley
   Fineman, MD, an allergist with the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic,
   in Georgia.
   “You may need some skin tests to correlate the onset of your symptoms
   with specific pollen or outdoor allergens. Once you are diagnosed and
   can correlate that pollen, for example, triggers your symptoms, you can
   be on the alert,” he says.
   In general, tree pollen levels are highest in late winter and spring;
   grass and weed pollen tends to peak in late summer and fall. Mold, on
   the other hand, doesnt really have a specific season. Any time weather
   is damp and warmfrom spring thaw to the last gasp of summermold
   spores can be circulating in the trillions. Mold spores can be highest
   in rainy winter months in warm climates, such as California.
   If youre not sure what is triggering your symptoms, use [102]these
   Web-based self-tests from the American College of Allergy, Asthma &
   Immunology to find out if you might have [103]allergies or [104]asthma
   and to [105]locate the right allergist.
   Once you know whats triggering your allergies, and when the allergen is
   in season, you can start taking medication at the right time of year to
   stop symptoms before they start.
   Although the Internet-based pollen watchers and widgets are relatively
   new, the process of collecting and counting pollen has been going on
   for decades, and the results typically are published in local
   newspapers. Experts have long known that high pollen counts cause
   sniffling, sneezing, and other nasal allergy symptoms.
   “We collect the pollen the same way as we did before,” says Dr.
   Fineman, who also supervises a local pollen-counting station. “We used
   to send it by fax or call-in lines to local TV stations, radio, and
   newspapers, so it was more regional. Now, with the Internet, you can
   get an email that says what the pollen count is in your area every
   day.”
   And thats a good thing. “People who are diagnosed with asthma that is
   made worse by pollen and people who have been diagnosed with seasonal
   allergic rhinitis need to keep track of pollen and other outdoor
   allergen levels,” says William Lunn, MD, the director of the
   interventional pulmonary service at Baylor College of Medicine, in
   Houston.
   To get started, heres a guide to the worthwhile Web tools that can help
   you fight sniffling, sneezing, and watery eyes.
     * The Weather Channel
       [106]Sign up for pollen alerts that can be sent to you via email or
       text message. You just plug in your information and select the time
       of day you want the alerts, and how often.
     * The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology
       The AAAAIs National Allergy Bureau offers an [107]interactive map
       that allows users to click on a location for current pollen and
       mold levels in that area. This same service also allows people with
       allergies to [108]sign up for email alerts with trees, weeds,
       grass, and mold counts from their local monitoring center.
     * [109]Pollen.com
       This website offers a wealth of interactive, personalized
       information on pollen counts. It boasts a free [110]Allergy Alert
       application for iPhone and iPod Touch users that supplies one- or
       four-day forecasts in four categories: allergies (i.e., pollen),
       cold and cough, asthma, and ultraviolet rays. A sister site,
       [111]PollenWidgets.com, also offers widgets for daily or four-day
       pollen counts available through Yahoo Widgets or Google Gadgets.
     * Pollen Report iPhone App
       [112]This app updates users on pollen levels in a specific area
       code. (Added bonus? You get the local high and low temperatures,
       too.)
     * [113]Airnow.gov
       This site, run by federal government agencies, doesnt have a pollen
       watcher, but you can use it to [114]check local levels of ozone, a
       pollutant that can make it harder for people with asthma to
       breathe. The site also provides a daily Air Quality Index as well
       as [115]email notifications. (You can even access [116]webcams to
       get a real-time look at local haze conditions.)
