   As a [99]sports nutritionist, I consult for pro teams and privately
   counsel professional and competitive athletes in numerous sports, as
   well as fitness enthusiasts. Pros and weekend warriors definitely have
   different nutrition needs, but they do have one thing in common: In
   order to get the most out of being active, everyone needs to eat
   properly to help their bodies recover from the wear and tear of
   exercise.

   Here are six rules to follow, and how to prevent overdoing it, which
   can cancel out the weight-loss benefits of breaking a sweat.

Eat within 30 to 60 minutes after exercise

   If you’ve had a particularly tough workout, try to eat a “recovery”
   meal as soon as possible. Exercise puts stress on your muscles, joints,
   and bones, and your body “uses up” nutrients during workouts; so
   post-exercise foods are all about putting back what you’ve lost, and
   providing the raw materials needed for repair and healing. In fact,
   it’s the recovery from exercise that really allows you to see results
   in terms of building strength, endurance, and lean muscle tissue. Not
   recovering properly can leave you weaker as you go into your next
   workout, and up your injury risk.

   RELATED: [100]11 Fitness Foods to Help You Get in Shape Faster

Think beyond protein

   Protein is a building block of muscle, so it is important post
   exercise, but an ideal recovery meal should also include good fat (also
   needed for healing muscles and joints), as well as plenty of
   nutrient-rich produce, and a healthy source of starch such as quinoa,
   sweet potato, or beans. These foods replenish nutrients that have been
   depleted, and provide energy to fuel your post-exercise metabolism. A
   great post-workout meal might be something like a smoothie made with
   either pea protein powder or grass-fed organic whey protein, whipped
   with fruit, leafy greens, almond butter or coconut oil, and oats or
   quinoa, or an omelet made with one whole organic egg and three whites,
   paired with veggies, avocado, and black beans.

Keep it real

   The phrase “You are what you eat” couldn’t be more true. Nutrients from
   the foods you eat food are the foundation of the structure, function,
   and integrity of every one of your cells. Your body is continuously
   repairing, healing, and rebuilding itself, and how healthy your new
   cells are is directly determined by how well you’ve been eating. In
   short, your body is essentially one big miraculous construction site
   that’s open 24/7. So even if you’re lean and you burn a lot of
   calories, avoiding highly processed food and eating a clean, nutrient
   rich, whole foods diet can help you get the most out of all of your
   hard work, including cells that function better, and are less
   susceptible to premature aging, injury, and disease.

   Your Weight

Don’t overcompensate

   If weight loss is one of your goals, it’s important to not overestimate
   how much extra food you “earned” working out. In fact, it’s incredibly
   easy to “eat back” all of what you’ve burned. For example, in a
   one-hour elliptical session, an average woman burns about 490 calories.
   A large salted caramel [103]Pinkberry contains 444 calories, and a 32
   ounce high-protein pineapple smoothie from [104]Smoothie King clocks in
   at 500 calories. Even if you don’t splurge on treats like these, you
   may be tempted to sneak a little extra almond butter, or be less
   mindful of your oatmeal or fruit portions, and those extras can add up.
   And if you’re going to be eating a meal within an hour of finishing up
   a workout, you don’t also need a post-exercise bar or snack. For more
   about how to prevent unwanted surpluses from interfering with your
   goals, check out my previous post [105]Help! Why Can’t I Lose Weight
   with Exercise.

   RELATED: [106]11 Ways to Stop Overeating After Your Workouts

Rehydrate

   If you sweat heavily, exercise in high humidity (which prevents cooling
   of the body), or your workouts last longer than 60 minutes, you
   probably need a sports drink rather than plain water during exercise.
   These beverages are designed to keep you well hydrated, but they also
   provide electrolytes to replace those lost in your sweat (like sodium,
   which makes sweat salty; and potassium, which helps regulate heart
   rhythm), as well as fuel to keep you going. If your workouts are less
   strenuous, shorter, climate controlled, or not so sweaty, plain H2O is
   probably fine. The general rule of thumb is to drink at least two cups
   of fluid two hours before exercise, another two cups 15 minutes prior,
   and a half-cup every 15 minutes during. Post exercise, aim for two cups
   of water (16 ounces) for every pound of body weight lost, and monitor
   the color of your urine—if you’re well hydrated it should be pale.

Watch your alcohol intake

   Many athletes and active people I work with enjoy imbibing a bit after
   working out. Alcohol in moderation is fine, but be sure to eat first to
   start the recovery process. Also, it’s important to know that alcohol
   has been shown to accelerate post-exercise muscle loss and the loss of
   muscle strength by as much as 40%. It can also interfere with
   replenishing glycogen, the storage form of carbohydrates you stock away
   in your muscles to serve as energy “piggy banks.” Less glycogen can
   translate into a lack of power or endurance during your next workout,
   so aim for moderation.
