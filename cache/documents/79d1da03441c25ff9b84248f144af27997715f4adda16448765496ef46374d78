   Scientists are exploring several ways these tiny needles may do their
   job.
   (M. NEUGEBAUER/ZEFA/CORBIS)
   After thousands of years of practice, we know that acupuncture works,
   but the West is still trying to understand why. Acupuncture derives
   from the concept in traditional Chinese medicine that disease results
   from a disruption in the flow of chithe body's circulating life
   energyand imbalances in the forces of yin and yang. Chi is said to
   flow along pathways in the human body known as meridians. According to
   Eastern thought, there are as many as 20 meridians and more than 2,000
   acupuncture points found along them. Applying tiny needlesor,
   sometimes, pressure or heatto those points is believed to deliver
   therapeutic effects for patients.
   The success of acupuncture is evident in its popularity in the U.S. and
   its growing acceptance among medical professionals. A 2002 National
   Center for Health Statistics survey estimated that 8.2 million adults
   had tried acupuncture. Acupuncture needles are regulated by the Food
   and Drug Administration, and the therapy is sometimes approved by
   insurance.

   But just how it works is a mystery Western researchers are still
   attempting to understand. In a consensus statement issued by the
   National Institutes of Health in 1997, scientists acknowledged that
   some of the tenets of acupuncturelike the flow of chi and the network
   of meridiansis "difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical
   information," but argued that there is "clear evidence" that
   acupuncture works for treatment of postoperative and
   chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. They also found evidence of
   pain relief from conditions such as postoperative dental pain,
   menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, and fibromyalgia. In other words, we
   don't know how it works, but it seems to. Here are a few ways going
   under the needles may alleviate pain.
