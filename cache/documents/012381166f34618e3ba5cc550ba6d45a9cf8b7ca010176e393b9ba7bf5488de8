5 Alzheimer’s Myths You Probably Believe

   November is [98]National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness month, a time
   for wearing purple and walking in honor of beloved family members. But
   it should also be a time when we take a step back and acknowledge how
   little we know about Alzheimer’s—and the impact our misunderstanding
   has on those with the disease, and their families.

   You see, we fear [99]Alzheimer’s disease. The prospect of losing our
   minds and memories engenders within us more anxiety than any other
   terminal illness, according to a 2012 survey by the Marist Institute
   for Public Opinion.

   We fear becoming the clichéd dementia patient: A grown woman throwing a
   tantrum in the grocery store. An older man making loud, lewd comments
   to passing strangers.  A vacuous entity that wouldn’t be out of place
   in a post-apocalyptic zombie horror film. We fear a stereotype that has
   been created, not out of callousness, but out of misunderstanding.

   “The hardest thing with this disease is having people around me—friends
   and family—and trying to explain to them every day what I go through,”
   says Rick Phelps, who has been living with Early-Onset Alzheimer’s
   Disease (EOAD) for over two years.

   Here are five common misconceptions many people believe to be true
   about Alzheimer’s:
    1. Alzheimer’s and dementia are the same: Alzheimer’s is actually a
       type of dementia—the most common type—which is why the two terms
       are often used interchangeably. Somewhere between 60% and 80% of
       people with dementia are thought to have Alzheimer’s.
    2. Forgetting a friend’s name means you may have Alzheimer’s: The
       difference between a memory slip that signals Alzheimer’s and a
       one-off incident of aging is the topic of much scientific debate.
       The general rule is: misplacing your keys every once in a while is
       normal, but forgetting what your keys are for could be a cause for
       concern.
    3. Alzheimer’s only affects the elderly: Dementia doesn’t just strike
       those with grey hair. The early-onset form of Alzheimer’s that Rick
       suffers from has been identified in people in their mid-30s. Only
       about 5% of those with Alzheimer’s have EOAD, but its effects can
       be especially devastating for families.
    4. We know exactly what causes Alzheimer’s: Science has yet to
       determine the precise cause of Alzheimer’s. Many medical experts
       believe that a combination of biological processes triggers the
       disease, including: the build-up of neuron-clogging beta-amyloid
       plaques, the accumulation of brain cell-killing tau protein
       tangles, and damaging inflammation triggered by an overreaction of
       the immune system.
    5. Alzheimer’s turns people into wheelchair-bound zombies: Perhaps the
       most destructive—and pervasive—Alzheimer’s myth is the notion that
       people with the disease are doomed to a future in which their human
       essence will be slowly stripped away. “It’s a terrible disease, but
       there’s a lot of good left in life,” says Michele DeSocio, whose
       mother has been living with Alzheimer’s for more than 15 years.

   To dispel this final falsehood, Rick, Michele and several other
   individuals who’ve been impacted by Alzheimer’s disease decided to
   share their real-life experiences in a groundbreaking story entitled,
   [100]Fade to Blank: Life Inside Alzheimer’s, a multimedia exploration
   of the human side of Alzheimer’s, through the eyes of those living with
   the disease.

   The goal of the online narrative is to spread awareness and educate
   people about the realities of life with Alzheimer’s.

   Michele calls the project, “A true labor of love. It is one of a kind.”

   “[Fade to Blank] is nothing less than breathtaking,” says Leeanne
   Chames, whose mother and mother-in-law both suffered from dementia. “I
   know, without a doubt, that it will touch so many lives.”

   Anne-Marie Botek is editor in chief of [101]AgingCare.com, an online
   community where family caregivers discover that they are not alone and
   gain the knowledge and support they need to help care for their elderly
   loved ones. [102]Fade to Blank was underwritten by AgingCare.com as
   part of a movement to change the way the world views people with
   Alzheimer’s disease.
