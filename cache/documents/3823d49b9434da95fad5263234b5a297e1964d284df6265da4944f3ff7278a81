5 Things You Should Know About Cholesterol

   Cholesterol seems to be one of those words that’s in everyone’s
   vocabulary, but many of my [99]clients are incredibly confused about
   what cholesterol is, and how it affects their health. It also happens
   to be buzzing in the media at the moment, thanks to a new report from
   the [100]Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, a group of top
   nutrition researchers who advise the government about what and how
   Americans should be eating.

   If you’re feeling a little perplexed by all this cholesterol talk,
   here’s a simple breakdown of what you really need to know.

Cholesterol is only found in animal-based foods

   There are two types: dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol. Dietary
   cholesterol is the cholesterol found in foods, and only foods of animal
   origin contain it, because animals’ bodies naturally produce this waxy,
   fat-like substance. So when you eat an animal-based food (think eggs,
   dairy, meat, seafood) you’re ingesting cholesterol that an animal’s
   body produced. Plant-based foods do not contain any cholesterol, so if
   you see a jar of nut butter marked “cholesterol free” know that they
   didn’t remove the cholesterol—it just wasn’t there to begin with.

   RELATED: [101]16 Most Misleading Food Labels

Cholesterol is essential for your health

   Even if you ate zero animal foods, you’d still have cholesterol in your
   body. That’s because your liver produces cholesterol and it’s needed
   for several key functions, including the making of hormones, vitamin D,
   and substances that help you digest food. While cholesterol is vital,
   it isn’t considered to be an essential nutrient, meaning something you
   must obtain from foods, like vitamin C or potassium. That’s because
   your body produces all of the cholesterol it needs.

   RELATED: [102]27 Mistakes Healthy People Make

There are “good” and “bad” types of cholesterol in your blood

   The two types of blood cholesterol you hear about most often are HDL
   (the “good” kind; think happy cholesterol) and LDL (the “bad” kind;
   think lousy cholesterol). HDL and LDL are actually [103]carriers of
   cholesterol called lipoproteins. HDL is good because it carries
   cholesterol away from arteries and back to the liver, where it can be
   removed from your body. LDL—the bad type—has the opposite effect. Too
   much LDL can lead to a build-up, which clogs and narrows arteries, and
   creates inflammation. This chain of events can lead to a sudden
   rupture, which sends a clot into the bloodstream, causing a heart
   attack and/or stroke.

   RELATED: [104]9 Subtle Signs You Could Have a Heart Problem

Dietary cholesterol may not impact blood cholesterol as much as previously
thought

   The old thinking was that consuming dietary cholesterol added to the
   cholesterol that your body naturally produces, thus raising the amount
   in your blood. This was perceived to be risky, because too much blood
   cholesterol has been shown to up the risk of heart disease, the top
   killer of both men and women. One often-cited statistic is that every
   1% increase in total blood cholesterol is tied to a 2% increase in the
   risk of heart disease.

   For many years, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that
   dietary cholesterol should be limited to no more than 300 mg per day.
   To put that in perspective, one egg yolk contains about 185 mg, three
   ounces of shrimp contains about 130 mg, two ounces of 85% lean ground
   beef about 60 mg, and one tablespoon of butter about 30 mg. The brand
   new report [105]eliminated this cap, however, because the committee
   believes that the research shows no substantial relationship between
   the consumption of [106]dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol
   levels. As such, they concluded, “Cholesterol is not a nutrient of
   concern for overconsumption.”

   RELATED: [107]14 Things Heart Doctors Tell Their Friends

The new guidelines aren’t carte blanche to other kinds of animal fat

   Nearly every media outlet covered the release of the report from the
   Dietary Guidelines committee, zeroing in on the [108]omission of
   cholesterol limits—but that doesn’t mean it’s now healthy to go out and
   down cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizzas. The committee is still
   concerned about the relationship between blood cholesterol and
   [109]saturated fat from foods like cheese.

   You may have heard about another recent report, which concluded that a
   lower intake of saturated fat wasn’t linked to a lower risk of heart
   disease. That’s true, but it’s not the whole story, because the risk
   really lies in what you replace the saturated fat-laden foods with.
   When people curb saturated fat, but eat more carbohydrates, they lower
   protective levels of “good” HDL cholesterol, and drive up triglycerides
   (a type of blood fat), a combo that may actually up the risk of heart
   disease. But numerous studies have shown that replacing foods like
   butter and cheese with plant-based fats like [110]almond butter,
   [111]avocado, and olive oil can help lower heart disease risk.

   Bottom line: the number one message from the new Dietary Guidelines
   report is that we all need to be eating less [112]sugar and processed
   foods, and more plants, including [113]vegetables, [114]fruits,
   [115]whole grains, [116]beans and lentils. So if you have cholesterol
   from something like eggs, pair them with other whole, nutrient-rich
   plant foods, like veggies and avocado, combined with some fruit, black
   beans, sweet potato, or quinoa. That’s good nutrition.
