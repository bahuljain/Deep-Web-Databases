     In Brief

     Quality of life (QoL) has been recognized as an important health
     outcome. Although assessing QoL is methodologically complex, valid and
     reliable tools are available and can be used with diabetes patients.
     Incorporating QoL measurement into diabetes care as part of a
     monitoring procedure is advocated.

      There is no certainty as to the origin of the term Quality of Life
      (QoL), but American economists Samuel Ordway (1953) and Fairfield
      Osborn (1954) are probably the first to have used the concept,
      expressing their concern over the ecological dangers of unlimited
      economic growth.^1,2 A few years later, John Galbraith's influential
      book The Affluent Society was published (1958), followed by The
      Industrial State (1967), in which he criticized the economic ideology
      of industrial expansion, stating "What counts is not the quantity of
      our goods but the quality of life."^3,4 American President Lyndon B.
      Johnson expressed this view in almost identical words at a 1964
      political meeting, stating "Goals cannot be measured by the size of our
      bank account. They can only be measured in the quality of lives that
      our people lead."

      In the 1960s, social scientists became more interested in the issue of
      quality of living, and particularly in the relationship between
      economic and social indicators of life quality on one hand, and the
      subjective evaluation of these circumstances on the other. Data from
      this Social Indicators Research suggested that the major determinants
      of high subjective quality of life are positive, close, and stable
      social relationships. In addition, the smaller the gap between
      expectations and achievements (or objective circumstances), the greater
      the level of reported happiness.

      Physical health appeared not to be a strong predictor of people's
      subjective well-being. In their 1976 study on the quality of American
      life, for example, Campbell and associates found that almost half of
      the people who reported disabilities severe enough to prevent them from
      doing "a lot of things" were unwilling to say that they were
      dissatisfied in any degree with their health, and a small number of
      them even insisted that they were completely satisfied with it.^5 The
      relationship between objective indices of wealth and health and the
      subjective evaluations of these circumstances appeared to be weak,
      implying that it takes more than improving people's physical
      circumstances to enhance their subjective quality of life.

      Partly under the influence of the aforementioned changes in the social
      climate and partly as a result of changes within the field of medicine,
      patients' subjective well-being gained growing recognition in medical
      care and research. In the post-World War II period, new medical
      technologies were introduced that dramatically increased patients' life
      expectancy, i.e., life "quantity," but not necessarily life quality.
      There was a growing need for standards by which the benefits and risks
      of new medical treatments could be evaluated, including patients'
      subjective evaluations. A new area of medical research was introduced.
      With the growing number of patients suffering from chronic diseases
      such as diabetes, care rather than cure became the focus of medical
      treatment,^6 and this development has caused a shift in clinicians'
      thinking about benefits, risks, and costs of medical interventions.

      It was not until 1976 that the concept of QoL was included as a keyword
      in the Index Medicus, initially under the subheading "Philosophy."
      Since the early 1970s, the concept has become increasingly popular, and
      numerous studies have been published on QoL in different areas of
      medicine, including diabetes. Studies on QoL are basically performed
      for two reasons.^7 First, they are conducted to evaluate the
      psychosocial functioning of (somatic) patient groups and to identify
      specific problems and needs of patients at different stages of the
      disease process. Second and most often, QoL studies are conducted to
      compare the impact of different treatment regimens on the patients'
      well-being and treatment satisfaction. Such comparative studies may
      provide clinicians with important information to support clinical
      decision making, taking both biomedical and psychosocial aspects into
      consideration.

      By 1999, more than 300 English-language articles on QoL in diabetes had
      been published in international peer-reviewed medical journals, the
      majority of which concerned type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes.

      The Concept of Quality of Life
      What is meant by the term quality of life? How is it defined? This is
      not an easy question to answer and has led to much controversy in the
      past years. To complicate the discussion, the terms quality of life,
      well-being, health status, and satisfaction are often used
      interchangeably.

      Hrnquist defines quality of life as a broad spectrum of dimensions of
      human experience, ranging from those associated with the necessities of
      life, such as food and shelter, to those associated with achieving a
      sense of fulfillment and personal happiness.^8 To narrow the scope to
      aspects of functioning directly related to the disease and/or medical
      treatment, the term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was
      introduced.^9 Walker and Rosser^10 define QoL in the medical setting as
      "a concept encompassing a broad range of physical and psychological
      characteristics and limitations, which describe an individual's ability
      to function and to derive satisfaction from doing so." Spitzer suggests
      that the term health status should be reserved for assessments that
      discriminate along a continuum beginning with "perfect health."^11,12
      He advocates that health-related or health-sensitive measures of QoL be
      used to quantify and describe attributes among those who are
      "definitely sick." QoL in this context refers to health-related
      problems, including the impact of disease and treatment on functioning,
      health beliefs, and subjective well-being.

      While no consensus has been reached on the definition of the concept,
      most researchers would agree that QoL a) is a multidimensional
      construct, encompassing aspects of psychological, social, and physical
      well-being, and b) should reflect the patient's subjective evaluation
      of well-being rather than the health care professional's view. The
      problem of defining QoL is often resolved by taking the "psychometric
      short-cut," i.e., by operationalizing the construct as a score on a
      questionnaire or set of scales, in the same way intelligence is defined
      as a score on the IQ test.^13

      Assessment of QoL
      Following the definition of HRQoL, assessment should be based on
      patients' self-report and should cover the relevant domains of daily
      functioning (physical, mental, social) for a particular disease and/or
      treatment regimen. In diabetes, relevant domains of QoL may include
      symptom distress, general physical functioning, mental/emotional state,
      social functioning, perceived burden of the treatment regimen,
      treatment satisfaction, and an overall sense of well-being.^14

      In past years, various generic and disease-specific QoL instruments
      have been developed for research purposes. Generic measures of QoL,
      e.g., the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)^15 or the Short Form-36 Health
      Survey,^16 allow for comparison across groups of patients with
      different diseases. However, such general measures may contain items or
      domains that have little or no relevance to a specific patient group,
      or conversely, lack specific items or domains that would seem typically
      relevant to that disease entity. The specificity of disease-specific
      questionnaires is an obvious advantage, but at the same time diminishes
      the possibility of comparison to other diseases.

      To ensure comparability of QoL outcomes across different patient
      groups, it is advised to include a generic QoL instrument along with a
      disease-specific questionnaire. Various diabetes-specific QoL measures
      have been introduced, both for type 1 and type 2 patients, that differ
      in specific content and focus of attention. These include the Problem
      Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale,^17 the Diabetes Health Profile
      (DHP),^18 the Diabetes Quality of Life Question-naire (DQOL),^19 the
      Diabetes Care Profile (DCP),^20 the Diabetes-39,^21 the Diabetes
      Symptom Checklist-type 2 (DSC-2),^22 and, most recently, the Audit of
      Diabetes Dependent QoL or ADDQoL.^23. For more information, see the
      article by William Polonsky on diabetes-related QoL in this issue
      ([1]p. 36, Understanding and Assessing Diabetes-Specific Quality of
      Life).

      Measurement Problems
      In QoL research, complex psychometric problems are encountered that are
      not always fully appreciated by clinicians and researchers. Too often,
      it seems, the validity and reliability of QoL instruments are taken at
      face value, partly as a consequence of the fact that funding
      opportunities for psychometric research are limited.

      Validity refers to the question of whether an instrument measures what
      it is intended to measure. In the case of QoL, validity is not easy to
      determine, because there is no "gold standard" for life quality.
      However, different aspects of validity, e.g., content, convergent, and
      discriminant validity, can be used to substantiate the psychometric
      validity of a scale.

      Content validity refers to whether an instrument samples all relevant
      topics. When developing a QoL questionnaire for a specific patient
      group, it may be extremely helpful to invite experts and patients to
      critically review the content.

      Convergent validity refers to whether the QoL scale relates (converges)
      with other measures of related constructs (e.g., emotional well-being,
      mood).

      Discriminant validity is demonstrated by no or low correlations between
      the scale and measures of clearly dissimilar constructs (e.g.,
      intelligence). Sometimes, discriminative validity is referred to as
      "extreme groups validity," reflecting the instruments' ability to
      classify or discriminate between distinct groups of patients on the
      basis of differences in scores.

      Reliability refers to the reproducibility of the finding, i.e., whether
      a measure produces similar results in a given situation. Reliability is
      of critical importance in QoL research, given the various confounders
      related to the methodology of self-report questionnaires.

      An extensive review of the methodological problems in QoL research is
      beyond the scope of this article. Useful handbooks on the subject, such
      as Bradley's compendium^24 and Streiner and Norman's practical guide^25
      are available for those with an interest in psychometrics. Here we will
      highlight some of the lesser-known psychometric issues encountered in
      QoL research.

      Self-report. QoL research strongly relies on self-reports, i.e.,
      subjective evaluations of people's functioning. It is important to note
      that in this context the term subjective, as opposed to objective, does
      not mean "soft" or unreliable, as is often assumed, but refers to the
      source of information: the subject. Subjective data can be obtained
      using reliable, objective methodologies for that purpose.

      However, as Schwarz points out, self-reports are a fallible source of
      data, and minor changes in question wording, format, or context can
      result in major changes in the obtained results.^26 For example, when
      asked how often they experienced a variety of physical symptoms, 62% of
      a psychosomatic patient group reported symptom frequencies of more than
      twice a month when the response scale ranged from "twice a month or
      less" to "several times a day." Yet, only 39% reported frequencies of
      more than twice a month when the scale ranged from "never" to "more
      than twice a month."^27 When developing a QoL instrument or evaluating
      an existing questionnaire, item content, wording, format, and scaling
      are critical issues to consider.

      In addition to emotional well-being, QoL research may include
      assessment of (changes in) patients' satisfaction with treatment, which
      is often found to be high, thus leaving little room for improvement.
      The highly skewed scores present a psychometric problem known as a
      "ceiling effect." Adapting the range of value labels (e.g., by adding
      "excellent" or "extremely satisfied") may overcome the ceiling effect
      and help to improve the instrument's responsiveness to change in
      satisfaction.^28

      Preference. QoL is often studied in randomized, controlled trials, in
      which patients cannot always be blinded to the different features and
      demands of the treatment modalities under study (e.g., pump therapy vs.
      multiple injections). Patients may have strong preferences for a
      particular treatment at the start of the trial, and this preference may
      (consciously or not) influence the patient's adherence to and
      consequently effectiveness of the treatment regimen. The problem of
      patient preference does seem to warrant a different experimental
      approach, taking initial preferences into account, rather than assuming
      that they play no role.^29

      Adaptation. An issue of interest in QoL studies is the fact that
      patients tend to adapt cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally to
      changes in their physical status. The phenomenon of psychological
      adaptation is illustrated in studies showing that cancer patients do
      not necessarily report lower well-being levels than healthy control
      subjects.^30 We all know from daily life that people have a tendency to
      adapt to changing circumstances and to make the best of their lives.

      The weak relationship between people's objective health status and
      their appreciation of life quality may be explained at least in part by
      adaptation or "habituation," a phenomenon that has also been observed
      in people whose circumstances have definitely improved, such as lottery
      winners, who do not necessarily report an improvement in well-being.^31
      In diabetes patients, psycho-physiological adaptation to elevated blood
      glucose is known to exist and can act as a barrier to glycemic
      improvement. Despite poor glucose control, patients may feel reasonably
      good and are therefore not inclined to intensify their treatment
      regimen.

      Response-shift. In trials evaluating QoL using a pre-post test design,
      it is assumed that the respondents' internal standard of self-rating
      does not change in the course of the study, thus permitting comparison
      of QoL scores before and after the intervention. However, cognitive
      adaptation may occur as a result of the intervention itself and bias
      the outcome of QoL research.^32

      This response-shift phenomenon was first observed in studies evaluating
      the effects of personal skills trainings using a conventional pre-post
      test design.^33 People joining a training may initially over- or
      underestimate their personal skills, and at postcourse assessment
      evaluate their skills from a different, and in fact more realistic,
      internal norm. In case of overestimation at the beginning of the
      course, comparison of the scores pre- and postcourse would suggest that
      the intervention had no effect or even a negative effect on the
      respondent's personal skills. Likewise, we know that type 2 diabetes
      patients can retrospectively (i.e., after having experienced a
      significant improvement in physical health due to intensified
      treatment) discover that they were not in such good shape as they
      believed to be at the time. ("Doc, I didn't know I could feel this
      energetic!")

      In research, patients may over- or underestimate their well-being or
      satisfaction at the start of a clinical trial, thereby masking the real
      (beneficial) effects of a new therapeutic device or treatment regimen.
      A potentially effective strategy to tackle the problem of
      response-shift in QoL research is to administer a retrospective
      pretest, after patients have completed the posttest. Instruct patients
      to look back at the start of the trial and rate their well-being at
      that time point as they perceive it now. By applying this so-called
      "now-then" approach, you can ensure that subjects' subjective
      evaluations before and after the intervention are made from the same
      internal standards.^34 Of course, this approach has the problem of
      being subject to demand characteristics, so that patients may assume
      they must be better off now than before.

      QoL and Glycemic Control
      One of the most intriguing findings from QoL research is the relatively
      weak association between patients' objective health status and their
      subjective life quality. Apparently, health in itself does not
      guarantee happiness, nor does good glycemic control. Studies looking
      into the relationship between diabetes control (HbA[1c]) and subjective
      well-being find low correlations, if any,^35-37 although there is
      evidence to suggest that patients suffering from diabetes-related
      complications (neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy) on average report
      lower levels of QoL compared to patients without secondary
      complications.^38,39

      One could argue that perceived QoL should not necessarily agree with
      objective parameters of metabolic control (e.g., HbA[1c]), because
      laboratory measures do not translate into tangible physical sensations
      unless values are in the extreme range. Also, the benefits of improved
      glycemic control may be outweighed by the perceived burden of intensive
      self-management that is required to achieve strict glycemic control.

      The relationship between QoL and glycemic control is complex, as is
      shown in Figure 1. Basically, four combinations of QoL and glycemic
      control can be observed in patients with diabetes. While some patients
      experience good QoL in conjunction with good glycemic control (A),
      others report satisfactory QoL despite poor glycemic control (B).
      Patients in the latter group may "deny" their diabetes, allowing them
      (at least temporarily) to enjoy life without having to bother too much
      about their diabetes and the treatment regimen. In some patients, poor
      QoL exists despite good metabolic control (C). This may be related to
      the burden of having to self-manage diabetes on a day-to-day basis. It
      may be a consequence of other life stresses unrelated to the diabetes.
      Poor glycemic control and poor QoL may coincide in patients, often
      negatively affecting each as both cause and effect of poor diabetes
      control.

   Figure 1. The relationship between QoL and glycemic control (HBA[1c]).


      Large, prospective studies such as the Diabetes Control and
      Complications Trial (DCCT)^40 and the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study
      (UKPDS)^41 have researched the impact of intensification of treatment
      in diabetes on QoL and overall found no evidence for an adverse effect
      of strict glucose control on patients' well-being. This should come as
      no surprise and may well be related to the process of adaptation
      discussed above.

      Alternatively, the QoL results may be biased by a lack of specificity
      and/or sensitivity of the instruments used to quantify changes in QoL.
      For example, in the DCCT, a threefold increase of episodes of severe
      hypoglycemia was not found to be associated with a decrement in
      reported life quality, using the DQOL.^42 This finding seems
      counterintuitive given the major impact that severe hypoglycemia can
      have on patients' emotional and social well-being.^43

      Interestingly, a significant correlation was found in the DCCT between
      rates of severe hypoglycemic episodes and scores on the Symptom
      Check-list-90-R, a global severity index of psychological distress,^44
      but cause and effect are difficult to determine here. Jacobson and
      associates^45 found a consistent negative association between
      psychiatric symptoms and diabetes-related QoL using the DQOL. This
      finding may reflect a negative bias in cognitions in patients with
      psychiatric symptoms, such as depression. Indeed, in studies in type 2
      diabetic patients performed by our research group, "neuroticism"
      explained 10% of the variance in well-being scores, and diabetic
      symptom scores correlated significantly with the level of
      depression.^46,47

      These findings point out the importance of the individual coping
      process as mediator or moderator between diabetes as stressor on the
      one hand and QoL outcomes and glycemic control on the other. Including
      coping in our research model may help us to better understand the
      observed inter-individual differences in QoL among patients suffering
      from the same illness.

      Coping generally implies successful adaptation, but in health
      psychology research, the term refers to specific cognitive and
      behavioral acts (coping responses) used by individuals to decrease a
      perceived threat and its associated stress responses or to solve
      illness-related adaptive tasks.^48 Research suggests that the way
      patients cope with the stresses of diabetes is determined by a complex
      interaction of individual characteristics (e.g., gender, age,
      socioeconomic status, personality), social support received from
      significant others, and important life events (e.g., loss of a job,
      divorce, becoming a parent, death of a loved one).^49,50

      In this transactional stress-coping model of diabetes, subjective QoL
      is regarded as an adjustment outcome, next to glycemic control (Figure
      2). To enhance patients' subjective QoL, in addition to optimal medical
      treatment, educational and behavioral interventions aimed at
      facilitating the patients' coping with diabetes may prove
      helpful.^51,52

      Conclusion
      In recent years, QoL has been recognized as an important outcome of
      medical treatment and has become a core issue in diabetes care.
      Numerous clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of
      diabetes and different treatment modalities on patients' subjective
      QoL. Fewer studies have been conducted to explain individual
      differences in QoL and the role of coping. The measurement of QoL
      involves complex methodological issues related to the use of
      self-reports as the primary source of information, and validity and
      reliability of QoL instruments deserve critical evaluation.

      Although generally appreciated as the primary goal of diabetes care,
      patients' QoL is most often not monitored systematically as an integral
      part of diabetes routine control, as recommended in the World Health
      Organization/International Diabetes Federation St. Vincent Action
      Programme.^53 There is still much work to be done in this area. The
      development of valid, reliable, and user-friendly QoL assessment
      procedures can help to facilitate the actual integration of QoL
      measurement in diabetes care.
