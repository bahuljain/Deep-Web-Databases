   Best Answer:  That's your processor usage
   The higher the processor usage, the slower your computer will run and
   the hotter your processor will get

       The CPU shows how much work the processor in your computer is
       doing. You computer is a big calculator, making thousands of
       calculations every second. When you computer is working very hard,
       the CPU indicator will go near to 100%
       100% means that the CPU is working flat out and it might go quite
       high if your computer is doing something intensive that requires
       alot of work.
       It's normal for your CPU indicator to go up and down in the graph
       and you should not worry about it, even if it is going to 100%
       every now and again.
       If the CPU indicator goes to 100% and stays there for several
       minutes (5 minutes) then it might be a cause for concern because it
       usually indicates that something is not working properly with your
       computer.
       You can check the process tab in the Task Manager screen which will
       show you which processes are using the most CPU. If there is one
       process that is using a large amount of CPU, then that process
       might be faulty. Remember, CPU can go to 100% for completely normal
       reasons, like you have just given your computer some hard work to
       do.
       If the CPU stays at 100% for a prolonged period of time then
       normally what happens is that some of your programs will seem to go
       a bit slower, because the CPU is concentrating on one task or
       process, all the other tasks get pushed aside while your computer
       works on the task that requires more work.
       If the CPU stays at 100% for several minutes more, the CPU will
       start to get hotter.
       After a few more minutes, your computers in-built fans will
       automatically increase speed in an attempt to cool down the CPU.
       You might hear the fans become louder as they try to suck more air
       in to cool down the processor chip.
       Even when this happens, it doesn't mean the computer is going to
       catch fire or explode.
       Some people get concerned when they hear the fans come on because
       they think their computer might catch fire. The fact is that modern
       computers have a thermostat inside which will shut down all power
       if the computer gets so hot that it is going to cause damage.
       I have seen this happen before but it is extremely rare so don't
       worry about that happening.
       If you do feel concerned about your computer, just turn it off for
       10 minutes, then turn it back on again.
       I hope the above has helped you. Please rate my answer if you found
       it useful.

       CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, and is basically your
       processor, ie. you may have an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, or an
       AMD Athlon 64x2...to name a couple of examples.
       Don't worry if your CPU speed jumps to 100% every now and then, or
       when it's doing something - this is completely normal. I have a
       system monitor on my desktop, and my CPU speed always increases to
       around 100% when I start a program, or load Internet Explorer, or
       when it's doing a background virus scan, etc.
       You should only be concerned if it remains at 100% for extended
       periods of time. However, if you're running a CD or DVD, it will
       probably remain very high (possibly at 100%) for the entire time
       the disc is running. It should then drop to normal speed when you
       eject the disc.
       You will also probably notice your CPU fan speeds up, ie. gets
       noisier, when your CPU is running at a higher speed. This is also
       perfectly normal - the fan has to speed up to ensure the CPU is
       kept cool while it's working.

       its just telling you how much work its doing and how much time it
       spent doing nothing. Yours looks fine probably jumps up when you
       move your mouse.
       when busy it will run quite happerly at 100% with no problems
       some machines will slow the cpu down when not in use to save power
       and produce less heat and save the battery power in laptops.
       if it was to stay at 100% and you are not loading or running
       programs then it might be worth checking what programs are running.
       If a program has got stuck in a loop or crashed it can use all your
       cpu time and slow everything else down.

       Click on the top of the CPU column twice. When you are not doing
       any processing the System Idle Process should be approximately 97%
       to 99%. If you are not doing any processing and the System Idle
       Process is a lot lower find out which process is working hard and
       is using your CPU, it could be a virus.

       CPU stands for (Central Processing Unit). It is the computers
       brain.
       The % percentages is how hard the CPU is being worked.
       For example 100% being maximum.
       Its perfectly safe, this usually happens when you have a load of
       applications running at once.
       To solve this you may want to consider upgrading your RAM, then the
       CPU won't be worked as hard.
       Good luck.

       This is the "Central Processing Unit" of the computer - or in basic

       Your computer sounds fine. If it does this often when you don't
       have any programs open, you could have something going on in the
       background that is eating up processor.
       Check the processes tab, and see what is using up the processor. If
       the name is not something you recognize, google it, it could
       possibly be something bad, or could be something perfectly normal.

       CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. The percentages you see are

   What is CPU?
   I can only see it in task manager when i press Ctrl + Alt + Del.
   It's going like this:
   15% - 0% - 100% - 5% - 4% - 8% - 4% - 7%
   Thats the record it's doing so far every 1-3 seconds.
   Is this good? Is my computer safe when it's like that?
   What happens when it exceeds to 100% For amount of time.
   Thanks
