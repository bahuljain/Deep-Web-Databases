The Truth About Low-Carb Diets

More and more women are slashing carbohydrates, hoping to slim down, feel
energized and beat disease. But new research suggests a carb-starved,
protein-centric diet might be hazardous to our health. Here's what you need
to know before you pass up the potatoes.

   fear-carbs
   Travis Rathbone
   Does a plate of pasta strike terror in your heart? A burger in a bun
   make you break out in a cold sweat? You're not alone. These days, we're
   skipping the bread basket in record numbers (the volume of bread, buns
   and rolls sold in U.S. stores fell by 9.1 percent between 2006 and
   2011) and shunning starchy vegetables. It seems like a new low-carb
   eating plan bursts on the scene every few months. And nearly one in
   three adults report that they're cutting down on or completely
   [93]avoiding gluten, according to market-research firm NPD Group.
   "Carb-phobia has really taken over people's minds," says Kim Larson,
   RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
   But here's the thing: Eliminating [94]carbs is risky business. "It's
   preposterous," says David Katz, MD, director of the Yale University
   Prevention Research Center and author of Disease-Proof. "All plants are
   carbohydrate sources, so eating no carbs means eating no plant foods,
   period." Carbs are important for your brain and body; the right ones
   even reduce your risk of disease.
   Yet the misconception that the fewer carbs you eat, the better persists
   among health- and diet-minded Americans. "Everyone is [95]jumping on
   this bandwagon," Larson says. "But the science just does not bear it
   out." In fact, studies now suggest that going low-carb for a long
   period of time may be harmful to our health.

   You can't live without carbs
   While many of us think of carbs as bread and [97]pasta, they're in any
   food that comes from a plant, including fruits, vegetables, nuts,
   grains, seeds and legumes. "It's a huge, diverse class of foods," Dr.
   Katz explains.
   To make carbohydrates, plants trap the sun's energy inside molecules of
   glucosea simple sugarthen connect the glucose molecules together
   (sometimes along with the other two basic sugar building blocks,
   fructose and galactose) to create longer carb molecules such as sucrose
   and starch. When you eat that plant, your digestive system breaks the
   longer carbohydrate back down into glucose, which travels through your
   bloodstream into your cells. The cells process the glucose, releasing
   the captured energy and using it for fuel.
   dont-eat-pasta
   Travis Rathbone
   Far from being poison, then, glucose sparks life. "If you're in a
   hospital and they need to get some energy into you, they'll use a
   glucose drip," says Joanne Slavin, PhD, professor of food science and
   nutrition at the University of Minnesota and chair of the 2010 Dietary
   Guidelines Advisory Committee on Carbohydrates. Dr. Katz adds, "If you
   don't have enough glucose in your blood, you're dead. It's that
   simple."
   While you don't have to eat carbs to get glucose into your blood (your
   body can manufacture it if needed), "carbohydrates are the most
   efficient fuel source that we have," says Heidi Schauster, RD, a
   nutrition therapist in Boston. Low-carb advocates (most famously Robert
   Atkins, MD) point out that your body can also use other fuel sources,
   such as protein or fatty acids, to power itself. But many experts say
   that this method of converting fats into so-called ketone bodies, known
   as ketogenesis, is much less efficient than using glucose for energy.
   And when too many ketone bodies are produced, the body is in a state of
   ketosis. "Ketosis can be tolerated for a short time, but in severe
   cases it could have very serious effects in the long term for the
   brain, as well as the kidneys, liver and skeletal system," Dr. Katz
   says.

   Besides providing much-needed glucose, plants are our only source of
   [99]dietary fiber. Like other carbohydrates, fiber is composed of many
   bonded sugar units, but human enzymes can't chop it up, so it passes
   relatively unscathed through much of the digestive tract. And it
   benefits you in many ways. "People who eat more fiber have less
   cardiovascular disease," Slavin says. "They also weigh less and gain
   less weight over time."
   You probably know that fiber helps move food through your body, keeping
   you regular. In addition, some forms of fiber (including resistant
   starch, found in bananas, lentils and many other foods) are prebiotics,
   a type of carbohydrate that feeds the growth of "good" bacteria in your
   gut.
   Not to mention, skipping carbs could mean falling short on essential
   nutrients. "Cutting out whole grains eliminates a good source of great
   nutrition, such as zinc, magnesium and B vitamins," Larson says. Steer
   clear of fruits and vegetables and you miss out on many vitamins and
   powerful antioxidants. These nutrients play a critical role in keeping
   us healthy long-term. "When we look at population-level studies of
   people who live well across the span of a lifetime," Dr. Katz notes,
   "they almost universally eat diets high in good carbohydrates."
