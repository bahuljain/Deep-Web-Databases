   Carbohydrate counting is an effective medical nutrition therapy option
   for adults with type 2 diabetes. This meal planning tool has increased
   in popularity as a result of research demonstrating the benefits of
   intensive therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes.^1 It can also
   lead to improved diabetes control and weight loss in adults with type 2
   diabetes. This article describes our experience in teaching
   carbohydrate counting in a diabetes specialty practice using
   "carbohydrate homework."

   In my full-time practice with an endocrinologist and diabetologist, I
   see a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes. Nutrition
   services are provided in one-to-one consultations, and 812 patients
   are seen per day. Our type 2 diabetes population spans the spectrum in
   terms of educational and socioeconomic level. Whether working or
   retired, many eat the majority of their meals out or on the run,
   because their spouse has died, their children are grown, or busy
   lifestyles don't allow for meals at home. Most have a misconception of
   the role nutrition plays in their diabetes control.

   When patients enter our practice, they often express frustration with
   their lack of glycemic control, lack of success with weight loss, and
   continuing problems with weight gain. Patients report frustration that,
   although they are following a meal plan and their premeal blood glucose
   levels are close to target, their HbA[lc] levels are still elevated. It
   is often at this frustration point that a patient first meets with the
   dietitian, and the concept of carbohydrate counting is introduced.

   Carbohydrate counting with fat- gram counting is an effective way to
   work on weight loss and to improve the control of diabetes.
   Carbohydrate is converted to blood glucose almost 100% within
   approximately 90 minutes after the meal.^2 Fat consumption, especially
   consumption of saturated fat, increases insulin resistance^3,4 along
   with abdominal body fat distribution, which is often associated with
   type 2 diabetes.^5

   Patients who understand how different nutrients affect their blood
   glucose level may be more receptive to strategies designed to improve
   blood glucose control. Working with patients on an individual basis, I
   am able to tie diabetes management therapies into their daily
   experience. My first visit usually includes an overview of diabetes,
   the role of medications if they are on any, and the role of nutrition
   and meal planning. One of the most useful tools I have found when
   working with diabetes patients is the post-meal blood glucose level
   excursion.

   After a discussion of the different nutrients, I have patients do what
   I call "carbohydrate homework." This involves recording nine meals and
   blood glucose levels pre- and 90 minutes post-meal. Patients record
   their blood glucose levels pre- and post-meal for three different
   breakfasts, three lunches, and three dinners. They also are asked to
   record the foods they eat, the amount, and if possible (depending on
   the educational capabilities of the patient), the carbohydrate grams
   and the fat grams (Table 1).



     Table 1. Instructions for "Carbohydrate Homework"

       * Record your blood glucose before and 90 min after each meal for
         three breakfasts, three lunches, and three dinners.
       * Record what and how much you eat for each of the nine meals.
       * Record the grams of carbohydrate eaten at each meal.
       * Record the grams of fat eaten at each meal.

   Often when patients return with their completed homework, they can
   determine their own diet prescription. When patients see the connection
   between what they eat and the glycemic response, they are usually
   impressed. Their pre- and post-meal blood glucose levels guide their
   carbohydrate and fat choices and portion sizes.

   Postprandial blood glucose levels are vital to overall diabetes
   control. Postprandial blood glucose excursions often cause elevated
   HbA[1c] levels.^6 Patients may be surprised by the magnitude of these
   excursions. When evaluating the carbohydrate homework, I average the
   pre- and post-meal blood glucose levels for each of the three meal
   categories. I then average the total carbohydrate grams for each of the
   meals separately and look at the fat consumption. In doing the homework
   assignments, I suggest:
     * First, looking at the patients' average post-meal blood glucose
       compared to their average pre-meal blood glucose level and average
       consumption of carbohydrate for each meal.
     * Asking whether restriction of carbohydrate could result in improved
       blood glucose control.
     * Being sure to leave patients with a realistic amount of
       carbohydrate for calorie requirements and nutritional balance.
     * Evaluating each meal separately, because a person's carbohydrate
       tolerance often varies throughout the day based on activity level
       and the degree of insulin resistance.

   Many individuals still believe that if they avoid sugar they should
   have no problem controlling their blood glucose levels. The
   carbohydrate homework shows them that all types of carbohydrate count.

   The tools I use to teach carbohydrate-gram counting include food labels
   and carbohydrate exchange lists. For fat-gram counting, I use the food
   labels and a handout on the fat content of foods developed by Nutrition
   Graphics. The food pyramid and the exchange lists facilitate discussion
   of which foods contain specific nutrients. Food models are also useful
   tools for demonstrating what size portions contain specific grams of
   carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

   Most patients find that carbohydrate- and fat-gram counting gives them
   the flexibility they need for family gatherings and special occasions.
   Today's lifestyle often does not allow the three structured meals that
   were common not so long ago.

   Carbohydrate-gram counting may be easier to use than the traditional
   exchange lists. However, some patients may be overwhelmed by counting
   carbohydrate and fat grams. With these patients, I may use carbohydrate
   exchanges or possibly the food pyramid to count carbohydrate servings.
   If a patient is still overwhelmed, a structured individualized meal
   plan outlining what and when to eat is developed. The patient is
   encouraged to use American Diabetes Association/ American Dietetic
   Association cookbooks and the Month of Meals books.

   Regardless of the meal planning approach selected, the carbohydrate
   homework is the basis for the meal plans since it provides information
   about carbohydrate tolerance for both the patient and me to use. This
   homework also helps patients understand that sometimes food choices may
   not be the only reason for blood glucose excursions; medication may be
   required to control blood glucose levels.

   If weight loss is a goal, the carbohydrate homework lets patients know
   precisely how much they are eating, especially if they are able to
   count the grams of carbohydrate. Serving sizes are often distorted, and
   many individuals are often surprised to find out just how many
   carbohydrate and fat grams they are consuming.

   Case #1
   M.A. is a 73-year-old woman who has had type 2 diabetes since 1972. She
   is retired, lives with her husband, and has a close-knit family of
   grown children who live nearby and are often present for family
   gatherings.

   M.A. is taking an oral antidiabetic medication but not insulin,
   although she has taken insulin in the past. She is 5 ft., weighs 219
   lb, and has a body mass index (BMI) of 43, despite working hard on
   weight loss.

   Her HbA[1c] is 9.3%, and her glucose logbook shows recorded premeal
   blood glucose levels averaging 140 mg/dl. M.A. has nonproliferative
   retinopathy and neuropathy affecting her feet and legs such that she
   can only walk with the assistance of a cane. She does not want to go
   back on insulin, yet she needs better control of her diabetes and
   expresses a desire to lose weight.

   M.A.'s carbohydrate homework is shown in Table 2.



                    Table 2. M.A.'s Carbohydrate Homework

     Breakfast Lunch Dinner
     * Average pre-meal blood glucose (mg/dl)

   141 163 112
     * Average blood glucose 90 minutes post-meal (mg/dl)

   320 194 145
     * Blood glucose excursion (mg/dl)

   179 31 33
     * Average carbohydrate g

   80 45 60
     * Average fat g

   12 25 30

   Evaluation of M.A.'s carbohydrate homework
     * Post-breakfast blood glucose excursion is unacceptable. Post- meal
       blood glucose excursions should be around 3040 mg/dl. This
       increase needs to be assessed on an individualized basis based on
       each patient's blood glucose goals. In some cases, even if the
       HbA[1c] is acceptable, the excursion after any one meal may be as
       high as 80 mg/dl.
     * Total intake of carbohydrate for the day is approximately 185 g or
       740 kcals. Total intake of fat is 67 grams or 603 kcals.

   Recommendations for M.A.
     * Decrease fat intake to 3040 g or 270360 kcals. This would lower
       the insulin resistance from fat, improve the cardiac profile, and
       decrease total kcal intake.
     * Limit carbohydrate at breakfast to 3040 g, at lunch to 45 g, and
       at dinner to 60 g. This would lower the post-breakfast blood
       glucose excursion. Lowering the post- breakfast blood glucose
       excursion should also result in a decrease in pre-lunch and dinner
       blood glucose levels.
     * The medical nutrition prescription is low in total kcals for weight
       reduction and maximizes diabetes control. Total intake of
       carbohydrate would be around 165 g or 660 kcals. Total calorie
       intake from fat and carbohydrate would be 9301,020 kcals.

   Case # 2
   E.V. is a 67-year-old man who is newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
   and is not on any diabetes medications. He has an HbA[1c] of 10% on
   diagnosis and a fasting blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl.

   E.V. is retired and lives with his wife. He is following a low-fat diet
   secondary to a history of cardiac problems. He weighs 205 lb, and is
   5'7" inches with a BMI of 32. He has not lost weight on the low-fat
   diet.

   E.V.'s carbohydrate homework is shown in Table 3.


                    Table 3. E.V.'s Carbohydrate Homework

     Breakfast Lunch Dinner
     * Average pre-meal blood glucose (mg/dl)

   220 188 185
     * Average blood glucose 90 minutes post-meal (mg/dl)

   190 205 180
     * Blood glucose excursion (mg/dl)

   -30 17 -5
     * Average carbohydrate g

   150 110 109
     * Average fat g

   15 12 35

   Evaluation of E.V.'s carbohydrate homework
     * E.V.'s total carbohydrate intake is 369 g, or 1,476 kcals.
     * His total fat intake is approximately 6070 g, or 540630 kcals.
     * E.V.'s diabetes control is not a nutritional issue. His post-meal
       blood glucose excursions are acceptable.
     * Weight reduction would be beneficial for a decrease in insulin
       resistance and hyperlipidemia.

   Recommendations for E.V.
     * Begin insulin sensitzer therapy.
     * Follow a low-saturated-fat diet for lipid control.
     * Follow a lower-kcal-diet for weight reduction.

   Summary
   Carbohydrate homework provides professionals the basis for developing a
   medical nutrion care plan that has the potential to improve blood
   glucose control. It serves as a mechanism to assess patients' tolerance
   to carbohydrate and fat and the need for nutritional or pharmacological
   intervention in the control of type 2 diabetes. Teaching patients with
   type 2 diabetes carbohydrate counting based on their post-meal glucose
   excusions can provide increased flexability with food choices and a
   means for better blood glucose control.
