Dr. Oz Defends Medical Advice After Calls For Dismissal From Columbia
University

   Dr. Oz Defends Medical Advice After Calls For Dismissal From Columbia
   University

   Doctor Mehmet Oz defended himself on Friday amid calls for his
   dismissal from his position as the Vice Chair of the Department of
   Surgery at Columbia University.

   Earlier this week, a group of 10 doctors from prestigious institutions
   such as Stanford, the University of California and the University of
   North Carolina sent a letter to Columbia University chiding Oz
   for ‚Äúpromoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal
   financial gain,‚Äù and calling his presence on the faculty of a
   prestigious medical institution ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù

   Oz quickly defended himself, saying [80]in a statement, "I bring the
   public information that will help them on their path to be their best
   selves. We provide multiple points of view, including mine, which is
   offered without conflict of interest. That doesn‚Äôt sit well with
   certain agendas which distort the facts.‚Äú

   In their letter, the doctors took issue with Oz‚Äôs treatment of GMO
   foods on ‚ÄúThe Dr. Oz Show,‚Äù citing his ‚Äúbaseless and relentless
   opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.‚Äù

   "I do not claim that GMO foods are dangerous, but believe that they
   should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world,‚Äù Oz
   said [81]in his statement. ‚ÄúI will address this on the show next week.‚Äù

   Most people know Dr. Mehmet Oz as America‚Äôs most famous doctor,
   occupying the coveted 4pm TV spot with his daily series, ‚ÄúThe Dr. Oz
   Show‚Äù.

   But what you may not know about him is that prior to becoming famous
   via ‚ÄúThe Oprah Winfrey Show‚Äù in 2004, Oz was (and still is) one of the
   most sought-after cardiothoracic surgeons in the country, practicing at
   New York City‚Äôs prestigious New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Since 1993
   he‚Äôs been on the faculty at [82]Columbia University, where he‚Äôs
   currently the Vice Chair of the Department of Surgery.

   On Wednesday, a group of doctors from across the country called on
   Columbia University to remove Dr. Mehmet Oz from their faculty list.
   Here‚Äôs the full text of the letter:

     Lee Goldman, M.D.

     Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine
     Columbia University

     Dear Dr. Goldman:
     I am writing to you on behalf of myself and the undersigned
     colleagues below, all of whom are distinguished physicians.
     We are surprised and dismayed that Columbia University‚Äôs College of
     Physicians and Surgeons would permit Dr. Mehmet Oz to occupy a
     faculty appointment, let alone a senior administrative position in
     the Department of Surgery.
     As described [83]here and [84]here, as well as in other
     publications, Dr. Oz has repeatedly shown disdain for science and
     for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless
     opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.  Worst of all,
     he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack
     treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.

     Thus, Dr. Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or
     flawed judgements about what constitutes appropriate medical
     treatments, or both.  Whatever the nature of his pathology, members
     of the public are being misled and endangered, which makes Dr. Oz‚Äôs
     presence on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution
     unacceptable.
     Sincerely yours,

   Last year, Oz‚Äôs credibility was called into question when he faced a
   Congressional hearing, during which members of the Senate‚Äôs consumer
   protection panel scolded him for claims made about products featured on
   his show.

   ‚ÄúThe scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of
   the efficacy of the three products you called ‚Äòmiracles,‚Äô‚Äù [85]said
   Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. ‚ÄúWhen you call a product a
   miracle, and it‚Äôs something you can buy, and it‚Äôs something that gives
   people false hope, I don‚Äôt understand why you need to go there.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI actually do personally believe in the items I talk about on the
   show,‚Äú [86]said Oz. "I passionately study them. I recognize they don‚Äôt
   have the scientific muster to present as fact but nevertheless I would
   give my audience the advice I give my family all the time, and I have
   given my family these products. Specifically the ones you mentioned,
   then I‚Äôm comfortable with that part.‚Äù

   Repent

   Oz, for his part, has never endorsed products or companies featured on
   ‚ÄúThe Dr. Oz Show‚Äù, and does not receive payment for featuring products
   on the show. For the most part, when a brand is featured, he brings on
   an independent expert to discuss the pluses and minuses of the product,
   and acts more as an interviewer in those instances.

   But the doctor admits that brands often use his name, illegally, to
   sell their products. "If you see my name, face or show in any type of
   ad, email, or other circumstance,‚Äú Oz testified in the Congressional
   hearing , "it‚Äôs illegal‚Äù ‚Äî and not anything he has endorsed.

   On Thursday, Columbia University replied to the group of doctors
   calling for Oz‚Äôs release:

     Dear Dr. Miller et al,
     As I am sure you understand and appreciate, Columbia is committed to
     the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members‚Äô
     freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.
     Regards,
     Doug Levy
     Chief Communications Officer
     Columbia University Medical Center
