Got ‘Bitchy Resting Face’? Fear Not: You May Be a Great Communicator

   It’s not exactly a diagnosable condition, but “bitchy resting face” can
   be problematic for the poor folks who have it. That is: A default
   facial expression that comes off as overly serious or even aggressive.
   But there’s good news for those who have BRF (or as it’s sometimes
   called, “resting bitch face”) — they might in fact be great at
   communication.

   At least, that’s the determination of Rene Paulson, who admits in an
   [98]essay on Quartz that she has the face; that, plus having a
   sarcastic talent means she’s easily misunderstood when trying to
   communicate with others. But as the successful head of her own company,
   she writes, “I view my [BRF] as much a blessing as a curse.”

   She points to Dr. John Lund, a researcher and public speaker on
   interpersonal communication, who has said, “Instead of communicating to
   be understood you have to communicate to not be misunderstood.” Since
   owners of the face have to go that extra distance on a regular basis,
   they quickly become an expert in ensuring others “get” them.

   [99]MORE: Bitchy resting face is real (kind of), but there’s hope

   “Women confronted by a world that automatically attaches negative
   attributes to their non-smiling face must quickly learn how to
   communicate and also hone a finely tuned awareness of both our own
   emotions and the emotions of those around us,” she writes, emphasizing
   that women with the condition have to be extra self-aware and
   empathetic.

   That said, she notes, constantly being hyper-aware of others’ reactions
   can be tiring. “I often find a two-hour meeting with strangers more
   exhausting than a 16-hour workday.”
