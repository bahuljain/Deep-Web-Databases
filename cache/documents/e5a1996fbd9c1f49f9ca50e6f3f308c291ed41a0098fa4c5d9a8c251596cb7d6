   Best Answer:  Assuming that you still have Expos√©'s "application menu"
   function mapped to the F10 key, you can do the following in Terminal:
   osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 109'

       I don't know about the command line code for that, but the Keyboard
       and Mouse pane in System Preferences will pick up your connected
       keyboard and provide relevant choices for that hardware... If you
       connect a keyboard or mouse that has less functions available than
       the apple keyboards, you'll need the manufacturer's drivers to do
       that. On mine, I have an aluminum Mac keyboard that when I select
       the fourth tab, "Keyboard Shortcuts" then scroll down almost to the
       bottom, I can see listed under "Dock, Expose, and Keyboard" a
       selection for "Application Windows" which is assigned to "F10."
       If you're referring to cycling through all your windows one at a
       time, try the article I found here:
