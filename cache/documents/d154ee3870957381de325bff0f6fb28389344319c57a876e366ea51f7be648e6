   When you want to shed serious weight, walking might not even come to
   mind. But it should.
   "Fast-paced walking, when combined with healthy eating, is hugely
   effective for weight loss," says Art Weltman, PhD, director of exercise
   physiology at the University of Virginia. And those simple steps can
   have a big impact on your overall health, cutting your risk of
   everything from heart disease to depression. If your daily strolls
   haven't made you skinny so far, your speed may be the problem. Many of
   us stride more like a window-shopper than a power walker. The
   goalthankfullyisn't crazy race-walker style; you just need to move at
   a challenging pace.
   In studies, Weltman has found that women who do three short (about
   30-minute) high-intensity walks plus two moderately paced recovery
   walks a week lose up to six times more abdominal fat than participants
   who simply stroll five days a week. (This despite the fact that both
   groups burn the exact same number of calories.)
   The power walkers also drop about four times as much total body fat.
   "There is a strong relationship between intensity of exercise and
   fat-burning hormones," says Weltman. "So if you're exercising at a pace
   considered to be hard, you're likely to release more of these
   hormones." The best part: When women walk, deep abdominal fat is the
   first to go. That's a scientific fact we can get excited about.
   Another happy truth: Although you're moving at a fast clip, power
   walking is still easier on the joints than running. "During walking one
   of your feet is always in contact with the ground," says Weltman, "but
   during running there's a float stage where your whole body is lifted in
   the air. Then you come back down and subject your body to the impact."
   That's why walking is a smart long-term fitness plan. To get you off on
   the right foot, here's a complete primer, from how to tweak your speed
   for maximum burn to what gear you need (hint: almost none). Follow the
   workouts and wisdomalong with healthy eatingand not only can you lose
   those extra 10 pounds in three weeks, but you will have a no-fuss plan
   that you can do anywhere, anytime.
   Dial in your speed
   To make sure your pace is on point, use these guidelines from exercise
   physiologist Tom Holland, author of Beat the Gym. For maximum fat burn,
   aim for 30 minutes at power-walk intensity three days a week (see the
   walking plan on the next page). That time can be completed all at once,
   or you can break it up into spurts with recovery strides (stroll or
   brisk walk) in between.
     * Stroll. Think window-shopping pace, or an intensity of 4 on a scale
       of 10. It burns about 238 calories an hour.
     * Brisk walk. This means an effort of 5 or 6 on a scale of 10. It
       burns up to 340 calories an hour (at a 3.5 to 4 mph pace). While
       you can gossip about Mad Men, you need to catch your breath every
       few sentences.
     * Power walk. You're torching off approximately 564 calories an hour
       (at a 4 to 5 mph pace). Moving at this clip, using your arms to
       help propel you forward and taking longer strides, your effort
       should be a 7 or 8 on a scale of 10. Talking is possible only in
       spurts of three or four words,
       but...you'd...rather...focus...on...breathing.
