   module? If so, which ones? Justify your answer
   d.) Which parameters, if changed by the called module, will the calling
   module recognize as changed values?
   e.) Which parameters have more than one location in the computer; one
   associated which the calling module and the other associated with the

   Best Answer:  a.) Average, Count, AgeSum, Count, Length, Width, Height
   b.) Average, Volume
   c.) The call-by-value parameters cannot be changes in the module, since
   you will be working with an copy of the parameter's values that are not
   linked back to the original input parameters
   d.) The call-by-reference parameters. These parameters, once the called
   module completes, will reflect any changes made to the parameter by the
   module.
   e.) The call-by-value parameters. A copy exists at the level in which
   the module is called, and at the level in which the module is executed.
   f.) The call-by-reference parameters. The copy exists at the level in
   which the module is called, and at the module execution level the
   parameter is a pointer* that points to the original parameter passed
   into the module.
   *: If you haven't explicitly covered the theory of pointers in whatever
   class this is for, I would re-word this answer, as this is a specific
   computer theory term that, unless taught, would likely indicate outside
   help with these questions.
