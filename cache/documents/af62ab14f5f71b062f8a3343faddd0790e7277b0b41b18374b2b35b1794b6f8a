   WEDNESDAY, Nov. 4, 2009 (Health.com)  Taking a low-dose aspirin every
   day can help prevent heart attacks in people whove already had one. But
   if youve never had a heart attack (or stroke), the risks of taking a
   daily low-dose aspirin outweigh the benefits, according to a U.K.
   report published in Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin.
   About 50 million Americans take low-dose (325 milligrams per day or
   less) aspirin to prevent cardiovascular problems. Some do so even
   though they dont have heart disease or a history of heart attack or
   stroke, an approach known as primary prevention.
   Currently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends low-dose
   aspirin for primary prevention in people with diabetes who are at risk
   for cardiovascular diseasebut this will be changing. (Diabetes can
   dramatically increase the risk of developing heart disease.)
   “Because of some recent studies suggesting that the benefit is not very
   large, and because aspirin can also have risks (intestinal bleeding or
   hemorrhagic stroke), the January 2010 recommendations will recommend it
   mostly for higher-risk people than was the case in the past, when it
   was recommended for people with more moderate levels of risk and
   above," says M. Sue Kirkman, MD, the vice president of clinical affairs
   for the ADA.
   The authors of the new analysis say theres not enough evidence to
   justify the routine use of low-dose aspirin to prevent cardiovascular
   disease in apparently healthy people, including those with elevated
   blood pressure or diabetes.
   Dr. Kirkman stresses that people with diabetes who are taking
   aspirinand have no history of heart attackshould talk to their doctor
   and see if he or she recommends continuing the therapy.
     “There isn't a strong rationale to take people off it if they're
   doing fine,” she explains.
   Although aspirin thins the blood and helps prevent clots, it is not
   risk free, according to the U.K. review led by a panel of experts.
