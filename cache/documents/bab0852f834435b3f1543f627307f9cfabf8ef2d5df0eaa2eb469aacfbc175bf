   If you’re wondering why your [98]nurse pals are posing proudly across
   your Instagram and Twitter feeds, you can point fingers at the hosts of
   ABC’s The View for their cracks about one [99]Miss America contestant’s
   impressive talent.

   While co-host Michelle Collins shared her thoughts on this
   year’s pageant during Tuesday’s episode of the daytime talk show, she
   brought up the fact that contestant Kelley Johnson wrote and performed
   a monologue [100]about her nursing career for her talent portion.

   “There was a girl who wrote her own monologue and I was like ‘Turn the
   volume up, this is going be amazing—let’s listen,'” Collins said. “She
   came out in a nurse’s uniform and [101]basically read her emails out
   loud and, shockingly, did not win. I swear to God it was hilarious.”

   Her co-host Joy Behar then chimed in, “Why does she have a
   [102]doctor’s stethoscope on?”

   Collins continued the cringeworthy commentary by telling the crowd,
   “She helps patients with Alzheimer’s, which I know is [103]not funny,
   but I swear, you have to see it. Like, Google it if you can.”

   Nurses across the country immediately rallied on social media to
   support the 22-year-old Miss Colorado, who has yet to address the
   comments publicly. Using the hashtag [105]#NursesUnite, men and women
   began sharing photos of themselves in scrubs—and stethoscopes (yes,
   nurses do use them)—with fiery messages directed at the The View
   roundtable members.

   [123]Dear Joy Behar, Who are you to define talent? Maybe the day you or
   your loved one are in need of the passionate care of a nurse and
   his/her "doctor's stethoscope" in a "costume" you will respect and
   appreciate the genuine talent nurses hold. God bless, Emily RN, BSN
   P.S. you insulted the wrong profession. #NursingISatalent

   Collins and Behar definitely heard the message; [124]the hosts
   addressed the controversy during their segment on Wednesday and assured
   that “We love nurses. We adore you; we respect you.” (Collins on-air
   apology came after [125]she first quipped on Twitter about the “hidden
   anger you nurses possess” and advised them to “prescribe themselves a
   Valium.”)

   “You guys are wonderful. You’re the most compassionate people,” Collins
   continued. “I was not talking about her as a nurse. We were talking
   about the talent competition, and it got misconstrued.”

   She also added that all of the nurses deserve raises: “Give ’em more
   money. Give them everything. Give them my money,” Collins said.

   Behar, on the other hand, said she wasn’t paying close enough attention
   during the segment and didn’t realize Johnson was in fact a nurse.
   Instead, she mistakenly thought a contestant was just in a costume. “It
   was just stupid and inattentive on my part,” Behar added.
