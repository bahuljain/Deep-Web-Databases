   Best Answer:  If your muscles are sore it means they were working. Your
   muscles were getting toned exactly at the places where you felt sore
   the next day.
   Squats are not low impact at all. They really build your stamina as
   well as muscles.

       Just wanted to remind you that you shouldn't work out the same
       muscle group/s more than one day in a row. Squats will work your
       butt, quads and hamstrings pretty effectively. The lower you squat,
       the more muscle groups they work. So with that in mind, you need to
       give your legs at least 48hrs to recover. While your leg muscles
       are repairing themselves the next day, I would suggest doing some
       upper body exercises instead.
       BTW, you should do a light warm-up before doing your squats. A
       squat is not a stretch, it is a resistance exercise that uses your
       own body as weight. So, a few minutes walking on the spot, then a
       few leg stretches beforehand, should be sufficient. To reduce the
       soreness the following day, do some more leg stretches after the
       squats.

       The fact that your legs are sore is proof that the muscles are
       growing stronger. So, yes they work.
       To tone your legs you need high reps and low weight. So just doing
       a lot of squats with no weights here would work fine.

       Squats work for the legs like pushups do for the arms. It's a body
       weight resistance exercise. (Not necessarily a stretching
       exercise.)
       It's good for toning and strengthening the leg muscles,
       specifically the quads and gluts.
       "Weight-lifting and resistance exercises like squats and lunges can
       seriously firm up flabby bits."

       squats are a very good exercise because it is impossible to work
       your heart without using your legs.If you are a lady,the best
       figures i have ever seen are ladies that squat weight.Just remember
       to use good form,knees travel right over toes as you
       squat.shoulders back and chin up.GOOD LUCK !!
