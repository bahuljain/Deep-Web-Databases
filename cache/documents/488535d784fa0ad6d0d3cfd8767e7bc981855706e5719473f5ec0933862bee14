        __________________________________________________________________

      The treatment of diabetes is complex, involving numerous lifestyle
      adaptations and requiring a great deal of teaching and support.
      Advances in technology have contributed to the need for education and
      patient participation in care. Many procedures formerly performed by
      health care professionals, such as blood glucose monitoring, are now
      routinely done at home by patients.

      In the past 20 years, nursing has been a major contributor to the
      improvement in the quality of care provided to people with diabetes, as
      shown in the findings of the Diabetes Control and Complications
      Trial.^1 Working with professionals from other disciplines, nurses have
      helped develop and test National Standards for Diabetes Patient
      Education. These standards still serve as a guide to the planning,
      implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive, quality programs. The
      recognition process for meeting the National Standards for Diabetes
      Self-Management Education currently offered by the American Diabetes
      Association^2 came from this initiative.

      In 1986, an examination was developed through the National
      Certification Board for Diabetes Education (NCBDE) to certify diabetes
      educators.^3 According to the NCBDE national office staff, there are
      currently 10,000 certified diabetes educators (CDEs), 50% of whom are
      nurses (personal communication, February 10, 1999).

      Although many diabetes educators are nurses, until recently few have
      been nurse practitioners (NPs). The role of NPs has expanded to include
      the diagnosis and the medical management of both acute and chronic
      conditions.^1

      One obvious advantage of being an NP is that NPs can legally adjust the
      diabetes medications, order diagnostic tests, and refer patients for
      consultations. Diabetes educators who are not NPs are often faced with
      delays in treatment, lack of continuity of care, and additional expense
      for patients in obtaining physicians' orders. This limitation has
      inspired many diabetes nurse educators to consider additional training
      to become NPs.

      Because the role of NPs in diabetes management is evolving, it is of
      interest to look at the components of this advanced practice role and
      give some real examples of how the care of people with diabetes can be
      enhanced by looking at several NP-managed patients. The potential
      contribution of NPs to primary care includes both cost containment and
      improved quality of care.^1

      Definition of a Nurse Practitioner
      Nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have completed additional
      education and clinical training so that they may diagnose and treat
      many common and chronic illnesses, focusing on health promotion and
      disease prevention activities, including patient education and
      counseling.^4,5

      Primary Care Nurse Practice acts differ from state to state, which
      explains the variation in legal and prescriptive authority and
      reimbursement. Each year, the January issue of The Nurse Practitioner
      offers a state-by-state update. In general, NPs have either a
      certificate or a master's degree as an NP, work in collaboration with a
      physician, and can prescribe medications in most states.^6

      Responsibilities include taking histories, performing physical
      assessments, developing differential diagnoses, and actually managing
      disease, as well as using research findings to improve outcomes.^7
      Prescribing is particularly important in the care of people with
      diabetes since medications and devices are commonly recommended.^3

      In a survey of NPs practicing in Connecticut, it was found that most
      NPs see "significant numbers of patients with diabetes," often without
      any organized diabetes programs.^8 The merging of the roles of
      certified diabetes nurse educator and NP promises to provide more
      specialized, high-quality care to patients with diabetes.

      How does the NP role differ from the role of clinical nurse specialists
      (CNSs)? NPs perform certain medical tasks, such as carrying out
      physical examinations, ordering and interpreting laboratory tests, and
      prescribing medications. CNSs place a greater emphasis on the role of
      consultant and educator to patients, families, and staff. Often not
      directly involved in care itself, CNSs provide care providers with the
      necessary knowledge and skills to deliver care.^9

      The blending of the roles of NPs and CNSs has many advantages. They
      include greater likelihood of reimbursement (through NP status) and
      cost effectiveness, as well as greater role flexibility to include
      consultation, education, and research.^9 Cost effectiveness includes
      any activities that lead to improved outcomes and a reduction in the
      use of expensive health care services. Whether involved in direct or
      indirect care, it is important for advanced practice nurses to serve as
      role models and continue to be leaders who creatively adapt to our
      rapidly changing health care delivery system.

      Following are some case studies of NP-managed patients.

      The Patient With Syndrome X
      Nancy Reilly Wohl, RN, MSN, ANP-C, CDE

      A.W. is a 56-year-old white man who presented with chest pain and newly
      diagnosed atrial fibrillation 6 years ago. He had a vague family
      history of diabetes, weighed 320 lb, had a blood glucose level of 352
      mg/dl, and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His primary care
      physician discharged him on an oral agent and scheduled follow-up
      visits.

      The NP met A.W. 3 years later at a diabetes class, where he presented
      on the maximum dose of the oral agent with a hemoglobin A[1c] of 14.7%,
      weight of 290 lb, blood pressure of 146/92, increased triglyceride and
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, decreased
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and proteinuria.

      A.W. was diagnosed with Syndrome X, the term used to describe an
      insulin-resistant state characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL
      cholesterol, hyperglycemia, central obesity, and hypertension.^10,11
      Syndrome X patients require, at least initially, a vigilant management
      approach to help educate them about the many components of their
      condition while offering encouragement and support. NPs have the
      knowledge and ability to work with Syndrome X patients independently
      through frequent visits and telephone follow-up.

      The NP, in collaboration with other members of the health care team,
      provided A.W. with a blood glucose meter and education and provided
      nutritional counseling and other information about diabetes management.
      Each visit included performing a focused physical examination, ordering
      and reviewing laboratory data, and adjusting medications. The NP was
      able to deliver this care independently, saving A.W. time and the
      institution money.

      Over the next year and a half, A.W. was able to dramatically improve
      his health status. The NP placed him on insulin therapy and quickly
      changed to BIDS therapy (bedtime insulin, daytime sulfonylurea). An
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor helped manage his hypertension
      as well as his renal insufficiency. Unfortunately, A.W. was not a
      candidate for metformin because of a history of alcohol use.

      As his blood glucose levels improved, so did his lipid profile. Weekly
      visits coordinated by the NP with other health care providers (e.g.,
      psychiatrist, podiatrist, dietitian, ophthalmologist) along with
      frequent telephone triage calls by the NP to review blood glucose
      values and make adjustments in the treatment regimen substantially
      improved his status.

      A.W. has recently married, lost 25 lb, has a normal lipid profile, and
      has controlled hypertension, reduced proteinuria, and a hemoglobin A[1c
      ]of 8.0%. He is on 5 mg of glipizide in the morning and 10 U of lente
      insulin at bedtime. He comes to regularly scheduled appointments with
      the NP and no longer requires telephone triage but feels free to call
      when assistance is needed.

      The NP was able to provide the medical management, education, and
      coordination of the interdisciplinary services that were needed to
      achieve success in the complex care required for this Syndrome X
      patient.

      The Patient With a Nonhealing Foot Ulcer
      Terry Gray, RN, PhD, ANP-C, CDE

      B.F. is a 63-year-old black man with a 20-year history of type 2
      diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD),
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and peripheral neuropathy. Although
      he had noticed a yellowish drainage on his sock and an odor from his
      shoes approximately 1 month before his visit, he delayed seeking
      treatment.

      B.F. had stopped seeking medical care 3 years ago when he was advised
      to begin insulin therapy but refused. Within a short time after
      starting insulin, B.F.'s father suffered a lower-extremity amputation
      and died, and B.F. feared the same fate. Now he has just "found a big
      hole" in the bottom of his foot and knew he needed help.

      The NP examined B.F. and diagnosed acute cellulitis and a chronic
      infected ulcer. Pressure sensation was measured using the
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. B.F. was placed in risk category 3 due
      to the presence of the ulcer and inability to perceive filament
      sensation.^12

      It was decided to treat B.F. as an outpatient with elevation of the
      extremity, bed rest, and complete nonweight bearing because any
      pressure from continued use of the injured area would spread the
      infection into adjacent tissues.

      An X ray was ordered to rule out osteomyelitis. Amoxicillin, a broad
      spectrum antibiotic covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, was
      chosen because most chronic infected ulcers are polymicrobial in
      nature.^13 The NP reviewed blood glucose monitoring technique and asked
      B.F. to test at home four times a day and to call in the results
      weekly.

      The NP closely followed B.F., and the ulcer healed within 2 months.
      Follow-up included discussions about blood glucose values and the
      importance of adherence to recommendations regarding diet, activity,
      foot care, prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia,
      and stress management. B.F. was referred for extra-depth, molded shoes
      in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the ulceration.^14,15

      Complicating factors in this case included the presence of significant
      ASHD, dyslipidemia, PVD, and an insensate foot. The radiological
      examination demonstrated soft tissue swelling but no evidence of
      osteomyelitis. After a Doppler study revealed significant lack of blood
      flow to the left lower extremity (LLE), B.F. was referred to a vascular
      surgeon for evaluation and treatment. He underwent a successful
      femoral-popliteal bypass graft of the LLE.

      The dyslipidemia was addressed using dietary modifications, exercise,
      and a fibric acid derivative, gemfibrozil.^16 After 6 months, the lipid
      profile improved.

      B.F.'s inability to perceive pain and fear of insulin therapy precluded
      his seeking medical treatment in a timely manner. Once under the care
      of the NP, B.F. discussed his fears and learned the benefits of
      glycemic control.

      He was immediately enrolled in the hospital-based diabetes
      self-management training program, where the NP is one of the
      instructors. He completed the course and became more attentive to his
      diet, blood glucose monitoring, and an "arm-chair" exercise program,
      and lost 14 lb. These activities were instrumental in lowering his
      HbA[1c ]from 14.5 to 8.9%.

      B.F. now understands the danger of an insensate foot and is meticulous
      in his daily foot care, making sure to include a thorough foot
      inspection every morning and evening. The close relationship he
      developed with the NP helped support him through this complex treatment
      plan. The NP offered not only medical management, but a great deal of
      education and encouragement, which facilitated B.F.'s adjustment to
      lifestyle changes that were necessary for him to achieve success.

      Initiating Insulin Pump Therapy
      Phyllis Furst, RN, MA, ANP-C, CDE

      C.O., a 26-year-old white man with type 1 diabetes for 8 years, was
      referred to the NP for counseling and initiation of insulin pump
      therapy. He frequently had to work late hours and found that he had
      difficulty maintaining good glycemic control on multiple daily
      injections due to his demanding and unpredictable schedule.

      The NP discussed the pros and cons of insulin pump therapy.^17 C.O. was
      enthusiastic about the increased flexibility the pump would provide.
      Issues such as exercise and dating were explored. Both available
      insulin pumps were demonstrated, as well as the various choices of
      infusion sets.

      After obtaining insurance coverage for the pump, C.O. was ready to
      begin the intensive, 8-hour pump training program, consisting of six
      individual outpatient visits with the NP. During the training, the NP
      reviewed skills such as blood glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia
      management, ketoacidosis prevention, and sick-day management. The
      nutritionist reviewed the meal plan and instructed C.O. in carbohydrate
      counting.

      Next, the NP began to demonstrate pump programming and function
      applications, insulin supplementation for high blood glucose levels,
      the protocol for clogged infusion sets, and pump alarms and discussed
      when to seek medical help.^17 Based on his total daily dose of insulin
      before initiation of insulin pump therapy, the NP calculated C.O.'s
      starting basal insulin rate of 0.6 U/hour as well as his initial meal
      bolus amounts.

      C.O. left that visit wearing the pump with normal saline and mimicked
      actual pump usage for the next 10 days. He continued his previous
      multiple daily injection program during this time.

      For the fourth visit, C.O. came to the office fasting, with plans to
      have breakfast after the insulin was placed in the pump for the first
      time. His physician was called to review the planned insulin rates.
      Because C.O. planned to return to the referring physician for his
      diabetes management once stable on the pump, it was important to
      involve his physician in the dosage adjustments.

      C.O. was asked to review blood glucose levels and insulin rates by
      phone with the NP or the physician for the next 57 days. A return visit
      was scheduled with the NP 2 days later to troubleshoot pump questions,
      as well as to review blood glucose levels and make basal and bolus rate
      adjustments as needed. C.O. again demonstrated his skill in preparing
      and inserting a new pump syringe and infusion set.

      C.O. continued to call the NP once daily for the next 5 days and was
      able to achieve his target blood glucose levels in 10 days. Although
      this seems labor-intensive, it offers an important safety and support
      net for outpatient insulin pump initiation. C.O. scheduled an
      appointment for a follow-up visit with the NP 2 weeks after the initial
      insulin-start visit.

      A change to insulin pump therapy is a major therapeutic and lifestyle
      adjustment for people with diabetes. The NP's careful attention to the
      physiological, educational, psychological, emotional, and comfort
      aspects of insulin pump therapy eased the transition.

      Managing the Pregnant Patient With Diabetes
      Donna Jornsay, RN, BSN, CPNP, CDE

      T.V., a 36-year-old woman at 18 weeks gestation, was referred by her
      private obstetrician for diabetes education and counseling with the
      diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Her medical history was
      insignificant except for a pre-pregnancy weight of 350 lb. Her height
      is 5'9".

      The patient was screened earlier than usual because of risk factors for
      diabetes, including her weight and the presence of glycosuria. The
      3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) results were as follows:


   Fasting   Abnormal Values
   152 mg/dl >95 mg/dl
   1-hour
   390 mg/dl >180 mg/dl
   2-hours
   393 mg/dl >155 mg/dl
   3-hours
   376 mg/dl >140 mg/dl

      Normal values have recently changed and are based on the criteria
      adopted by Carpenter and Coustan.^18

      Given the abnormality of the GTT and her symptoms of diabetes, T.V. was
      informed that her diabetes was most likely type 2 rather than
      gestational diabetes. The NP began treatment by teaching T.V. about the
      maternal and fetal risks of diabetes during pregnancy, including the
      increased risk (up to 25%) of congenital malformations. T.V. was
      informed that although she did have an increased risk for a congenital
      malformation, an ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram performed at 1822
      weeks gestation would provide an accurate diagnosis of the fetus's
      condition. The NP outlined the advantages of maintaining excellent
      glycemic control for the remainder of the pregnancy, including
      decreasing the fetal risks of macrosomia and stillbirth and the
      neonatal risks of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and
      hypocalcemia.^18,19

      The NP discussed the probability of previously undiagnosed type 2 and
      outlined the necessary treatment. This included dietary management,
      fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose monitoring, urine ketone
      monitoring, multiple daily insulin injections (NPH and regular before
      breakfast, regular before dinner, and NPH at bedtime), and outpatient
      fetal monitoring. The NP instructed T.V. in blood glucose monitoring,
      urine ketone testing, insulin self-administration, and exercise
      guidelines.

      A registered dietitian gave her a 2,400-calorie American Diabetes
      Association (ADA) meal plan as calculated based on her weight and
      caloric needs for pregnancy. The meal plan included three main meals
      and three snacks per day.

      All of this information was presented slowly, allowing time for
      questions and expressions of feelings.

      As the NP was teaching T.V. blood glucose monitoring, her blood glucose
      level was 237 mg/dl 2 hours after breakfast. After discussing the
      situation with T.V., the NP decided to admit her to the inpatient
      high-risk obstetric unit to expedite her education and glycemic
      control. Her HbA[1c ]at this time was 11.7% (normal 4.46.4.%), thereby
      giving the fetus a 22% risk of a congenital malformation.^19

      The NP provided medical management and coordinated T.V.'s care,
      including ordering a comprehensive ultrasound as soon as possible
      (ideally done at 1820 weeks gestation) and a fetal echocardiogram at
      2022 weeks to rule out any malformations.^20 The NP reviewed the
      results of these tests and discussed them with T.V. Fortunately, both
      of these exams were within normal limits.

      T.V. needed much support and reassurance as she began to grasp the
      concept that her diabetes would most likely not go away at the end of
      her pregnancy. Fortunately, her dilated eye exam, 24-hour urine, and
      EKG were all within normal limits, thereby indicating that she had not
      developed any chronic complications of diabetes.

      Insulin treatment was initiated at 0.8 U/kg current weight, which is
      recommended for 18 weeks gestation. Her current weight was 165 kg. Her
      initial insulin regimen was 56 U NPH/28 U regular 30 minutes before
      breakfast; 22 U regular 30 minutes before dinner; and 22 U NPH at
      bedtime. Based on T.V.'s obesity, the NP steadily increased these doses
      up to approximately 300 U of insulin by the time of delivery.

      The first week after discharge, the NP maintained daily phone contact
      with the patient to review her blood glucose results and to adjust her
      insulin doses and meal plan as needed.^21 From 19 weeks gestation
      onward, the patient was able to be managed as an outpatient with weekly
      phone contact and biweekly visits to the NP in addition to her regular
      obstetric visits. The insulin doses increased as the pregnancy
      progressed, and she was able to maintain her blood glucose values
      within the expected range of 60120 mg/dl.

      The NP initiated daily fetal movement recording at 26 weeks. Based on
      her initial poor glycemic control, twice weekly nonstress testing was
      begun at 32 weeks, and serial ultrasounds were done to assess fetal
      growth. All her fetal surveillance testing was within normal limits.

      T.V.'s care was specialized and labor-intensive. The NP was able to
      provide the continuity and attention that T.V. needed to see her
      through this high-risk pregnancy.

      T.V. had a vaginal delivery of a 7 lb, 3 oz baby at 37 weeks gestation.
      Her baby girl was in the neonatal intensive care unit for several days
      with hyperbilirubinemia and difficulty feeding, but did well.

      Two years postpartum, T.V. has lost approximately 50 lb. and is
      continuing to lose weight. She has type 2 diabetes for which she is
      currently being treated with three injections per day of insulin after
      failing on oral agents. Since this NP only treats diabetes in
      pregnancy, she referred T.V. to the NP in adult endocrinology to
      control her glucose values so that she can avoid long-term
      complications of diabetes and be able to share a long and healthy life
      with her husband and children.

      Conclusion
      Jane Jeffrie Seley, RN, BSN, MPH, MSN, GNP, CDE, CHES

      Managing patients with diabetes effectively requires a great deal of
      time, effort, and patience. As discussed in the cases outlined above,
      diabetes NPs are able to deliver quality, cost-effective care by
      applying all of the combined skills and knowledge from their training
      as nurses, NPs, and diabetes educators.

      Studies looking at the effectiveness of NPs in primary care reveal not
      only competence but equivalent or slightly improved patient outcomes,
      most likely because the NPs spend more time talking with patients and
      individualizing treatment regimens.^22 The trend for more diabetes
      nurse educators to become diabetes NPs can only lead to better care for
      people with diabetes. In the future, diabetes NPs could be utilized in
      primary care settings where there is a high volume of patients with
      diabetes.

      As a gerontological NP presently consulting in a busy general medicine
      practice (Beth Israel Medical Center's General Medical Associates
      [GMA]), I am able to provide a higher level of care to my patients with
      diabetes because I also bring to them 20 years of experience as a
      diabetes nurse educator. My colleagues value my ability to support my
      patients through the complex management plan. I am thought of as an
      expert in diabetes management as well as in successfully helping
      patients adhere to the complex medical regimens prescribed.

      Collaboration with the physicians and other NPs in the practice works
      both ways and benefits both providers and patients. More diabetes
      patients are thereby able to receive a higher level of care at a lower
      cost in a general medical practice. Patients continue to be referred to
      endocrinologists when blood glucose levels are not well controlled
      within a reasonable period of time.

      Many NPs like myself are already providing primary care to populations
      known to be at higher risk for diabetes, e.g., minorities and the
      elderly. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness
      of diabetes NPs in collaborative practice in primary care and to
      establish if they are truly delivering quality, cost-effective care
      according to the standards set by the American Diabetes Association.^1

      GMA joined its affiliate St. Luke's-Roosevelt in instituting the
      Diabetes Initiative Plan to improve care delivery to patients with
      diabetes. GMA physicians and NPs worked together to develop a diabetes
      checklist, which is included on the medical record of all GMA patients
      with diabetes. The checklist reminds providers when to perform
      appropriate testing and evaluations such as HbA[1c] levels, foot
      examinations, and podiatric referral, according to ADA standards of
      medical care for patients with diabetes. This program has been very
      successful to date.

      The next step will be to improve the knowledge of the current treatment
      of diabetes among GMA providers. Professional education that increases
      awareness of the importance of diabetes management is a valuable tool
      in reducing and preventing the complications of diabetes.^1 Diabetes
      NPs can serve as role models and educators, offering professional
      education in diabetes care and management to their colleagues in
      primary care. This is a perfect blend of the CNS and NP roles.
