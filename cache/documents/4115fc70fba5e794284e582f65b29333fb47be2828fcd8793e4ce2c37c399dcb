   My son was diagnosed with Type I two weeks ago.  He is 19 and very
   athletic.  It was devastating to him, but as we became more educated,
   he began to accept it and I am very proud of how well he is doing.  He
   is a sophomore in college and on a soccer scholarship.  He has played
   soccer since he was three years old.  It is his life and his passion.
   He was so afraid this would prevent him from playing.  After meeting
   with the Endocrinologist, he was relieved to hear that he can play
   soccer, he just has to adjust his insulin, as physical activity will
   make his sugar fall.  She gave him a letter allowing him to return to
   physical activity.  We kept in contact with his coach and the athletic
   director while he was in the hospital and when he was diagnosed.  This
   occurred only one week before the end of his soccer season.  Yesterday,
   his coach met with each player one on one for an end of season
   evaluation.  His coach told him "I would be very disappointed if you
   return to the team next year".  He told him he didn't want him on the
   team and that he would not play him if he returns next year.  He could
   not kick him off of the team and take away his scholarship because he
   has no grounds.    I don't understand how he can do this?  I do not
   think that it is a coincidence that he made this decision two weeks
   after his diagnosis.   My son has made every game except when he was in
   the hospital.  He has made every practice even when he was so sick and
   lost 26 pounds before his diagnosis!  He came in third on the fitness
   test at the beginning of the season.  The only reason the coach will
   give him is that he is basing this on "experience".  He has played
   since he was three. This is his second college season.   He has played
   in National Championships.  He made the Olympic Development Program.
   What can we do?  He is obviously discriminating against him because of
   his diabetes.

   Obviously the coach does not want to deal with a diabetic player.
   There ARE issues he would have to address; your son needs to go to him
   with an answer that addresses his issues; it would be helpful to know
   exactly what he's worried about, but some are obvious.  As  you've
   noted, increased physical activity will drive down your son's blood
   glucose, and that can lead to problems on the field.  Your son needs to
   be able to address that with the coach; have a plan before game time to
   prevent low blood sugar incidents, and how to deal with it during a
   game if it happens in spite of his pre-game preparation.  More
   importantly, your son will need to learn how to deal with it in the
   meantime.  He's newly diagnosed, and it may seem straightforward, but
   "surprises" can happen.  BTW - I was diagnosed T1 at age 11 in 1966.
   When I got to HS, I wanted to join the swim team (I had been a
   competitive diver in my local community, was certified in SCUBA, and
   was in excellent shape and always active).  The swim team coach would
   not even discuss it - he just wasn't going to deal with it.  If that's
   what you're up against, I'm not sure there's much you can do.  Legally,
   you may be able to force him to keep your son on the team, but you
   can't force the coaach to play him.  Welcome to Life - it's not fair.
   That's the first lesson I learned from being diagnosed T1.  OTOH - if
   your son does re-up next year, makes practices and performs well there,
   and demonstrates he can control his blood sugar ok, the coach may
   relent and play him, though he may have to sit the bench for a while
   beforehand.  It's quite possible that the coach is simply afraid of the
   unknown, or has had some bad experience in the past; until he's more
   comfortable with it, he'll remain that way.  By accepting the coach's
   decision not to play him, at least initially, and still participating
   at practices without incident, your son may be able to overcome the
   coach's doubts.  I know this isn't a very satisfactory answer, but it's
   the way things are.  I went through all of this with respect to many
   activities I was already in, as well as many others I wanted to get
   into and found myself excluded due to my diabetes.  But the most
   important thing for your son is to learn to deal with keeping his BG in
   a safe range while engaging in physical activity, which will impact his
   BG.  He should also educate a friend or two on the team so they are
   aware and can watch for changes in his behaviour that may indicate a
   low BG.  As the song says - you can get by with a little help from your
   friends.  Best of luck to you and your son - with all of the upcoming
   challenges.  I assure you, they can be overcome.

   Thank you for your words of encouragment, but I am pretty sure that the
   Federal Disabilities Act addresses this situation.  I think that we do
   have recourse and I am going to explore that.  You cannot simply decide
   not to play a player because he now has diabetes.  Especially since he
   was cleared by his doctor.

   Hi

   My son is 16.  I am sorry about your son's diagnolsis and really
   disturbed by the Coach's reaction.  Is this a D1 program that he is on
   an athletic scholarship?  There are two things I would keep in mind.
   First, the scholarship is worth a tremendous amount to your family
   financially.  The coach would probably like to see you walk away and
   open it up for another recruit.  No matter how upset you are, don't  do
   that yet.  Have you gone to the AD?  Mention of going to a local
   newspaper or tv station that covers this school might wake them up.  A
   lawyer might be a good idea also.


   Second, the school should have a student services office that will help
   your son and support him with his diabetes.  There is a parent's board
   for teenage and college age kids here.  If you post on there, several
   have experience with college and big universities.  I am sorry you are
   having to go though this.

   Thank you GS Mom.  Actually the school was quick to tell us that they
   have no resources for diabetics.  He has actually made up his mind to
   leave the school because this is just too much after what he has
   already gone through.  I am seeking legal advise though.  Not only for
   the discrimination, but for the fact that he lost 26 pounds in less
   then four weeks and the coaching staff and fitness trainers did not
   take notice.  He attended every practice and game although he had no
   energy and was visably ill.  This is a NCAA sponsored school.

   This makes me so sad.  how is he doing with all the diabetes stuff
   now?  My son was in dka and transported by a medical team to a
   children's hospital at diagnosis.  It was horrible.  My son had
   problems with his vision for a few weeks after diagnosis.  It took
   about 3 weeks for some of his energy to come back.  He suffered from
   headaches and stomach aches.  He was always hungry and gained back all
   th weight he lost quickly and then kept packing it on. and growing.  We
   were in touch with th endos office several times a week and insulin was
   constantly being adjusted. We kept a spiral notebook with blood sugar
   readings, carbs ate, dosage, notes, etc.  He did play baseball and had
   a great season right after diagnosis.


   As far as driving now, he checks blood sugar before getting behind the
   wheel.  He has a bag he tosses in the car with him that has fast acting
   carb tablets, blood sugar kit, snack.  Because he was diagnosed before
   he drove, he had to have a medical release from the doctor to get his
   liscense.  He will have to have that every time he renews now.  As far
   as auto insurance, they never asked.  Let us know how you are doing.
   Take care.
