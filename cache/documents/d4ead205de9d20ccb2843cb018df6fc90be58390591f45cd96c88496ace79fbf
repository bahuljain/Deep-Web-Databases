   Best Answer:  Normal insulin levels vary from lab to lab, but generally
   a level below 16 is considered normal. Insulin levels also vary
   depending on when you last ate. So your insulin level is high, meaning
   that your body must produce more insulin to produce the same response
   (insulin resistance). Insulin resistance is the underlying cause of
   Type II Diabetes. A person can be insulin resistant and not have
   diabetes, but they are certainly high risk for developing diabetes.
   Over time a person who is insulin resistant can lose the ability to
   compensate and develop clinical diabetes. It sounds like your doctor
   has been checking you for diabetes regularly and he/she should continue
   doing this.
   Insulin resistance and Type II Diabetes can be at least partially
   reversible. This is with aggressive lifestyle modification. This
   includes exercising at least 1 hour 5 days a week. Well balanced diet
   with many fruits and vegetables. Simply losing 5% of your body weight
   if you are overweight/obese can have a significant impact. So stop
   freaking out and do something about it. I hope this helps.

       Hi!
       First of all i should know what kind of test you took.
       A fasting insulin blood level that is higher than 10 uIU/ml is a
       flag for insulin resistance. If your doctor use a simple fasting
       glucose level he measured your glucose level after you've been
       fasting for several hours.
       The most specific test for diagnosis is a three hour
       insulin-glucose tolerance test. It involves drinking a premeasured
       amount of a special sugar beverage (75 grams glucose load). Your
       blood is draws at several hourly intervals and your insulin levels
       are measured at the same time as the glucose levels.
       People with insulin resistance have normal to low glucose levels
       and higher than normal insulin levels.
       Normal insulin levels would be in these ranges:
       - while fasting 10 uiu/ml or lower
       - after 1 hour 50 uiu/ml or lower
       - after 2 hours 30 uiu/ml or lower
       - after 3 hours 10 uiu/ml or lower
       Don't be afraid.
       Your health condition depends from the time you measured your
       insulin level.
       Maybe you have to make other analysis.
       Then ask to your doctor every therapeutic indication because not
       always the insulin resistance bring to diabetes, in every case it's
       a situation to keep under control.
       Moreover today there are very good treatment for diabetes too, you
       have only to be diligent and follow the doctor's instructions.
       I hope to be exhaustive.
       Good luck!
