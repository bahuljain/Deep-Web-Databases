Clear the cin buffer in c++?

   I have a simple loop which runs through
   cin>>typed;
   and some more code 20 time.
   My problem is that if i type a space at the cin point, the next time
   through the loop the typed is already filled and it skips over it. I
   understand I need to clear the buffer, but how? thanks

   Best Answer:  There is no buffer clearing functions for the input
   streams, but there are functions that consume unprocessed input. You
   can consume input from cin using
        std::cin.ignore(); // consume one character
   or something like
        std::cin.ignore(100, '\n'); // consume characters until end of
   line is consumed or 100 characters are consumed.
   If you want the most robust way to consume all input until (and
   including) the next end of line, it is
        std::cin.ignore( std::numeric_limits< std::streamsize >::max(),
   '\n');
   (don't forget to #include <limits> for numeric_limits)

       With all respect to Chubbi:
       If you are requesting input i.e. like
       char c = 0;
       cin >> c;
       This code has no impact on user's option to enter more then
       requested.
       This "additional" input is there ... buffered. It needs to be read
       out, before the next user input.
       cin >> c;
       // User input is i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 a z followed by a \n
       (Enter key)
       c contains '1'
       while (cin.get() != '\n');
       This would subsequently read 2 through \n in the above sample of
       user input.
       the next user input after the enter key will be processed.
       the assumption is that the user prompt clearly stated that the user
       is supposed to enter a single character (maybe limited to an i.e.
       alphabetical subset of a code set).
       the following code does the following:
       It reads one single char per loop into the variable c.
       Every user input after that - enter key included - will be ignored.
       if lower case letter q is entered followed by extra characters or
       \n, only, code after the loop will be executed.
       char c = 0;
       do {
       cin >> c;
       while (cin.get() != '\n');
       // do some processing
       // user input is: a b c d e
       // c contains a
       // In the next loop c contains the first character entered by the
       user
       } while (c != 'q');
       Have fun.
