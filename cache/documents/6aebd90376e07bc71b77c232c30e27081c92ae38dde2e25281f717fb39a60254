Make Your Carbs Count!

   large photo

   Having diabetes doesn’t mean you have to follow a low-carb diet or
   avoid carbohydrate foods. It is true that the carbohydrate you eat is
   the biggest factor affecting blood glucose after meals. However,
   research shows that many types of eating patterns can work for managing
   diabetes, and carbohydrate foods can be worked into an overall healthy
   meal plan. You’ll want to work with your healthcare provider to decide
   on how many carbs per meal is best for you.

   When you choose which carbohydrate foods to include, fill your plate
   with those that are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The best
   carbohydrate choices include:
     * Fresh, frozen, or canned fruit without added sugars
     * Whole grains such as 100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal,
       quinoa, and whole grain barley
     * Starchy vegetables such as potatoes, winter squash, pumpkin, green
       peas, corn, parsnips, and plantains
     * Beans, legumes, and peas
     * Non-fat dairy such as 1% milk, skim milk, and non-fat yogurt

   Non-starchy vegetables such as leafy greens, tomatoes, and carrots,
   have about 5 grams of carbohydrate in ½ cup cooked or 1 cup raw (though
   this can vary). Most of the carbohydrate in non-starchy vegetables is
   fiber. So unless you eat more than 1 cup of cooked or 2 cups of raw
   non-starchy veggies at one time, you may not need to count the
   carbohydrates from the non-starchy vegetables in your plan. When
   choosing sources of carbohydrate for your meal plan, focus on the foods
   listed above. Limit carbohydrate foods that have a lot of added sugar,
   salt, and fat. This is what we mean when we say to [13]Make Your Carbs
   Count! Here is a list of less healthy carbohydrate foods to watch:
     * Soda and other sugary drinks (It is best to avoid these all
       together and stick to zero-calorie beverages like water and
       unsweetened tea.)
     * Refined grain foods such as white bread, white rice, many crackers,
       pastries, and sugary cereals
     * Chips, pretzels, and similar salty snacks
     * Sweets and desserts

Some Tips to Remember

   It is important to choose healthy carbohydrate foods, stick to your
   meal plan, and control portions. Remember that even nutritious
   carbohydrate sources will raise blood glucose. A good way to control
   carb intake is to use our [14]Diabetes Plate to plan meals. This can be
   helpful tool to keep your carb intake consistent.

   When it comes to choosing grains, we recommend trying to make half your
   grains whole – if not more! There are three parts of a grain, and a
   whole grain includes all three: the bran, germ and endosperm (starchy
   part).  A refined grain (or non-whole grain) has been stripped of one
   or more parts. You can [15]find a list of the best starchy vegetables
   and whole grains on diabetes.org. There are many options to choose
   from. Here are some ways to incorporate more whole grains and healthy
   carbs into your day:
     * For lunch, try a whole grain salad mixed with some beans,
       vegetables, and a lean source of protein (like chicken or tuna). A
       few grains that you’ll find in stores now are brown rice, wild
       rice, farro, barley, bulgur, and quinoa. Dried whole grains such as
       these are the least processed grain products out there! [16]Read
       more about how to make a healthy grain salad.
     * Instead of white or refined grain products, buy those with a whole
       grain listed as the first ingredient. (i.e. Check labels on
       crackers, tortillas, pita bread, pasta etc.)
     * When buying bread, buy varieties that say 100% whole wheat on the
       package.
     * Make a chili or stew with beans, lentils, or peas for the carb
       source – these also add some lean protein to your day! You could
       also try adding brown rice or wild rice.
     * As a side, skip the potato chips, pretzels, and rice mixes.
       Instead, choose a starchy veggie like roasted potatoes or corn on
       the cob.
     * For snacks, replace processed snacks with fruit and nuts, fresh
       veggies and hummus, 100% whole grain crackers and low fat cheese
       stick.
     * Instead of eating sweetened yogurt, try some fruit with plain
       non-fat Greek yogurt.
     * If you normally eat sugary cereal for breakfast, try eating an
       unsweetened cereal and add some fruit in. Or, try out some plain
       oatmeal and add flavor by mixing in nuts, dried fruit, and
       cinnamon.
     * Instead of cookies or ice cream for dessert, curb your sweet tooth
       with piece of your favorite fruit.
