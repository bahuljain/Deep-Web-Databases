German Soccer Player Donates World Cup Prize Money to Sick Kids in Brazil

   Mesut Özil, a midfielder who helped lead Germany to its [99]World Cup
   victory over the weekend, is not only a champion, but also a class act.

   The soccer star, 25, confirmed on [100]his Facebook page that he’ll
   donate his prize money (or part of it, at least) to the charity BigShoe
   to help pay for the surgeries of a total of 23 Brazilian children in
   need—that’s one for every member of the German squad.

   Though it hasn’t been confirmed, the German players reportedly received
   bonuses of $400,000 for their big 1-0 win against Argentina.

   [101]BigShoe is a German charity that was founded during the 2006 World
   Cup held in Germany and its mission is to raise money to operate on
   children in need around the world. Though it hasn’t been disclosed what
   specific surgeries Özil will be covering, BigShoe funds operations for
   conditions such as congenital heart defects, burns, cataracts, and
   cleft palates and lips.

   This isn’t the first time Özil, who plays club soccer for Arsenal in
   the English Premier League, has lent a helping hand with medical bills,
   either. Before the World Cup, he [102]paid for the surgeries of 11
   Brazilian children.

   On his Facebook page, he said this was his “personal thank-you for the
   hospitality of the people of Brazil.”

   “I love children,” Özil said in a video in May about his involvement
   with the charity. “They are important to me and I want them to thrive,
   live their own life, and have a good chance in the future.”
