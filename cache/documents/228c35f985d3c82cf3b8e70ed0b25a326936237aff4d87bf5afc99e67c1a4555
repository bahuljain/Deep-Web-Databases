Start a National Team

   The American Diabetes Association (ADA) invites you to join a growing
   list of companies that have taken a very important step to Stop
   Diabetes^®.

                          CardinalHelath Team Golds

   Diabetes is one of the highest health care costs for your company, and
   a major contributor to lost productivity. With more than 29 million
   Americans living with diabetes, one out of five health care dollars is
   spent on diabetes care and management. This disease is placing a burden
   on the lives of many of your employees and their families in increasing
   numbers. According to the CDC, 1 in 3 Americans could have diabetes by
   2050 if current trends continue. New cost of diabetes data recently
   released demonstrates that diabetes continues to be a staggering
   economic cost for companies and the health care system:
     * $245 billion: Total costs of diagnosed diabetes in the United
       States in 2012
     * $176 billion for direct medical costs
     * $69 billion in reduced productivity

Hear what our National Team Members Say:

   "As leaders we are constantly looking for ways to better engage our
   teams in the important work we do at our company. The Tour de Cure is
   an incredible team building activity. It connects leaders with
   employees and fosters unforeseen networks across the volunteers,
   participants, and family members, too! Companies spend countless hours
   and thousands of dollars on staff retreats and team building activities
   when in fact starting a Tour de Cure team can achieve these same
   results and at the same time fulfill a civic responsibility. A Tour de
   Cure Corporate Team is a simple solution to a company's need for team
   building, healthy living and supporting the community all in one!"
   – Marshall Case, Lockheed Martin Team Captain, Silicon Valley
