   Thanks for your input.


   I was not thinking of switching to the Bernard diet  - I am happy
   watching my carbs and eating meat proteins.


   I just thought the Bernard regiman sounded a bit extreme.

   I agree. Especially when you really cut back on the so called "healthy
   whole grains" that really aren't very healthy for a diabetic in
   anything more than minor quantities, then cut back the rest of the so
   called "healthy" and starchy veggies and the fruit sugar laden fruit to
   portions that don't spike BG. Leaves one with a rather small selection
   left to choose from. So while I do enjoy non starchy veggies like
   broccoli, eggplant, etc., I also find adding some meat and cheese goes
   a long way into a sustainable and healthy diet. Also, just looking at
   how diabetes can be traced in my own family history to predate all the
   modern processed foods that currently get blamed, I'm confident the
   only way I could have prevented those diabetes genes from catching up
   to me would have been to die by the time I hit 40, or never been born
   at all. So I'll take the diabetes and eat to my meter...it tells me I
   can have a nice mix of foods, just like an omnivore is designed for

   Well EJJ, you are quite a spokes person for Barnard and his bunch.


   Let me ask you this, how did you happen to come to this diabetes
   message board?  You never mentioned being diabetic so what brought you
   here?  Are you diabetic?

   As a former TV investigative reporter for 18 years, and a current
   author who gets invited to speak all over, I have many Google alerts
   that I read daily. When I see blatant misinformation, as I did with the
   post I responded to, I just like to add my two cents. Take it or leave
   it. No one pays me. I just try to help others improve their health
   relatively easily, not counting calories and following what has worked
   for so many others. When you've watched your sisters go through
   wretched breast cancer multiple times, see your relatives lose limbs to
   diabetes and then followed by hearts getting cracked open for heart
   disease, you get pretty incensed when you see how a low-fat,
   plant-based diet can reverse it so relatively easily. Oh yeah, my best
   friend died of breast cancer too. On her death bed as the chemo ate her
   alive, she said, "Take care of my kids." She had a great hubby who did
   that. But speaking out when I can, is how I honor her request. She
   tried to change her diet the last months of her life. It was too
   little, too late.


   I also just watched the HBO 4-part series, Weight of the Nation, which
   if you have seen, is another huge reminder that preventable disease is
   not sustainable. And...that there is so much needless suffering that
   can easily be prevented. Maybe not for everyone, but for many. Worth a
   try before bariatric surgery...but maybe that's just me. The series
   points out how many kids are getting diabetes and heart disease in
   early childhood. That is not right.


   Since I've done Atkins, South Beach and every other diet under the sun
   trying to keep my girlish figure for TV and personal health, and now as
   a personal trainer and running coach, the "truth" seems pretty obvious
   to me. There's no money in broccoli. It really is that simple.

   I will repeat my question that you didn't answer yet.


   Are you diabetic?  Do you know anything about diabetes?

   His devotees are totally committed but rarely stay here more than a
   week or two. You can expect a few to appear in this topic shortly
   because they use bots to watch for a mention of Barnard.

   my ability to beat the odds.


   Google Center for Consumer Freedom and Rick Berman, and you'll see "60

   tobacco, firearms and fast food. As a reporter, I followed the money,
   and when you understand there's no money in broccoli, then you
   understand why you have to be your own investigative reporter. My
   cholesterol went from 135 to 203 in one year when I went from a vegan

   had, I learned later). It went right back down when I returned to vegan

     Barnard was one of the first doctors to write about a healthy
     plant-based diet reversing diabetes and heart disease.

   [121]Spoiler (Highlight to read)

   His work and that of many other plant-based docs have courageously
   helped Clinton and other CEOs who have figured out that this is much
   more convenient/cheaper than having your chest cracked open or taking
   insulin forever. His work has saved my life!


   I began teaching cooking classes and saw student's A1C numbers come
   down, and one woman lost 120 pounds in 8 months without counting a
   single calorie and loving the food. She had been given up for dead with
   multiple myeloma, and almost a decade later, she is still alive, blood
   work great, and a joyous vegan. Our local newspaper did a story on her
   (it's on my "Eat Vegan on $4 a Day" Facebook page) because her before
   and after pix were so dramatic. And yeah, I used my financial
   background to write the book after I saw too many stories of 300 pound
   women loading their carts with Twinkies saying, "You can't eat well on
   a budget." Nonsense...beans are way cheaper/healthier than meat/dairy.
   Not to mention how much money you save by avoiding doctors, disease and
   hospitals. I've crunched all those numbers.


   Eating whole foods in their natural state (healthy carbs, whole grains,
   lots of veggies) is the best kept secret in America! Why? Because
   there's no money in broccoli! There's no board, lobbyists or
   association. Do your homework on this, and you'll see the numbers and
   where the money goes. Ask any of your docs how many nutrition classes
   they took in med school. It's usually zero. Ask them how many junkets
   they went on sponsored by pharma, or who paid for new wings of their
   hospital. Ask who paid for the research they worked on. Then ask your
   doc if veggies are right for you. Oh yeah, a whole-grain, balanced
   plant-based diet can reverse ED too! All arteries and organs are
   connected. Connect the dots. These are diseases of affluence and they
   don't exist in countries that have access to our processed, high-fat,
   hormone-laden foods.


   My sis who had heart disease and diabetes...she was overweight and had
   "routine" herniated disc surgery during which, she flatlined while
   contracting MRSA through the IV. She's now a quadriplegic and got
   breast cancer within the year of the surgery. My dad lost his eyesight
   and limbs to diabetes...so common in this mostly preventable disease.
   Eating a plant-based diet as described by Barnard, is way easier than
   all that. I only say this because no one should endure the
   pain/suffering I've experienced and seen. Not in this country. Not
   anywhere. So what if a few animals are saved from the awful factory
   farming atrocities that well-documented now all over YouTube? That's
   why many kids are going vegan...they don't want to stick their heads in
   the sand and pretend they don't see. But it's also humans who can be
   helped as much too. I see this up close and very personal. I wish I had
   time to wait for more studies, but I don't have time.


   Preventable diseases are not sustainable, and if we don't get this
   under control, our country is doomed. It will be a game of survival of
   the fittest. I keep begging to be studied...you'd think researchers
   would be lined up at my door. Every study I've looked at in the last 6
   years requires you to have cancer or be willing to take a drug. Imagine
   that?! Barnard's way of eating (and Drs. McDougall, Furhrman, Essystyn,
   Campbell etc.) does work. Look at Clinton, and the growing numbers of
   folks who are figuring out that their doctor may not have the necessary
   education to figure this out. While people can be different, some of
   these concepts do work well for many or most people. Good luck on your
   journey!

   counting calories and following what has worked for so many others.
   When you've watched your sisters go through wretched breast cancer
   multiple times, see your relatives lose limbs to diabetes and then
   followed by hearts getting cracked open for heart disease, you get
   pretty incensed when you see how a low-fat, plant-based diet can
   reverse it so relatively easily. Oh yeah, my best friend died of breast
   cancer too. On her death bed as the chemo ate her alive, she said,
   "Take care of my kids." She had a great hubby who did that. But
   speaking out when I can, is how I honor her request. She tried to
   change her diet the last months of her life. It was too little, too
   late.    I also just watched the HBO 4-part series, Weight of the
   Nation, which if you have seen, is another huge reminder that
   preventable disease is not sustainable. And...that there is so much
   needless suffering that can easily be prevented. Maybe not for
   everyone, but for many. Worth a try before bariatric surgery...but
   maybe that's just me. The series points out how many kids are getting
   diabetes and heart disease in early childhood. That is not right.
   Since I've done Atkins, South Beach and every other diet under the sun
   trying to keep my girlish figure for TV and personal health, and now as
   a personal trainer and running coach, the "truth" seems pretty obvious
   to me. There's no money in broccoli. It really is that simple.

   At 59, Ellen Jaffe Jones is "THE VEG COACH." AKA "The Broccoli Rep."
   Because as she says, "Who else IS the broccoli rep?" She is an
   inspiring motivational speaker, personal trainer, running coach,
   author, and teaches healthy cooking classes designed by respected
   doctors and registered dieticians.

   Ellen's best-selling book, "Eat Vegan on $4 a Day" rapidly became her
   publisher's #1 seller. Ellen's publisher credits part of the success
   with Ellen's dedication to and use of social media saying, "Her success
   with social media has been amazing!" Ellen now coaches other authors on
   how to build their social media "presence." As a result of this
   success, her publisher requested that she write another book, which
   will be out later this year or early 2013.


   As an author and motivational speaker on the subject of Veganism I
   suspect you are paid rather well for advocating this way of eating.
   Cheers, Alan, Type 2, d&e metformin 2000mg, Australia.

   So much for subtlety there Alan, I consider all of her posts
   advertisements for her "business" and have reported her for this

   Am I the only one that is utterly tired of the continous HARASSMENT by
   these vegans? They're incredibly lucky that the internet is some sort
   of a no man's land, as there's very little legal recourse against
   behaviors like theirs that in real life could be punishable by law.
   Also, I can't believe that these people have animals as their #1
   priority over humans and don't have any scruples in HARASSING the
   community of the ADA forums (which is made up of people suffering from
   this terrible disease called diabetes) for their pro-animal agenda.


   I just hope that Matt and the other admins will deal very swiftly with
   this continous propaganda, because in all honesty, the more I see of
   this, the less I want to participate in any discussion/topic in the
   forums. This vegan offensive that has been constantly going on for
   months, really disgusts me.

   That is correct, I do not get paid for any of my appearances. I'll be
   lucky if I make enough money a few years from now to cover the cost of
   bringing my website up to current 21st century standards and buying a
   laptop suitable for travel.


   If you know anything about the struggling book publishing business, you
   would know that unless you publish many successful books or write the
   great Amercian novel, there's tragically little money to be made as an
   author.


   My publisher asks me to go speak a few times a month on weekends and
   pays my airfare and lodging at cheap motels. I know authors who blew
   their entire 50K advance hiring a publicist to try and get on Ellen.
   Most authors I know, like me, have successful "day" jobs that allow
   them to take the time, energy and personal money it takes to write a
   book.


   My financial goal is simply not to lose money on the whole thing. I
   didn't get paid any advance. This has been a total labor of love, and
   despite the intense hostility here, which I have no patience for, I
   take great satisfaction knowing I've helped a lot of people too.


   As I said, I'm doing this to try to get the word out about what has
   worked for me and so many people. My parents were so sick and diseased
   with heart disease and diabetes, that by the time I had kids, they
   couldn't lift them, let alone babysit them. Many news stories talk
   about the current generation may be the first to not outlive the
   generation before them. Like Bill Clinton who said as he went vegan, I
   want to be around for my grandkids.


   If you've checked me out as you say you have, you'll know that I have
   written that I am the only healthy person in my family of origin, by a
   long shot. That means I have no diseases. I'm not trying to hide that.
   To the contrary. I have been diagnosed as hypoglycemic since I was a
   child (too many flavors of Baskin Robbins), and have worked hard my
   adult life making sure that didn't erupt into the diabetes everyone
   else in my family had/has.


   Based on the similar writing styles, I suspect there are some paid
   flacks writing here as there elsewhere. Or maybe some people hide
   anonymously to say ugly things. I don't know and don't care. Of course
   people like me would spend little time here. Why bother or waste more
   time? I've said my peace and choose to spend my time in stressfree ways
   to avoid disease. I don't wish to engage in your personal attacks. I'm
   happy to share my knowledge, resources and information with anyone who
   is genuinely interested in learning, but not in a community that seems
   to have no interest and enjoys dissing with one-sentence attacks.


   If you find me on Facebook, you'll see all the races I've place
   in...plant-powered, pushing 60. The media have written about my ability
   to defy the odds of my huge family history of cancer, heart disease and
   diabetes. Those who are interested will continue the journey. Blood
   tests don't lie. Whatever works for you. Good luck to you all.


   And no worries, I have all the business I can handle with personal
   training clients. Regardless of diet, there's quite a demand for 60
   year-old personal trainers who can outrun most college/high school
   kids. Smiley Wink Must be doing something right, they think.
