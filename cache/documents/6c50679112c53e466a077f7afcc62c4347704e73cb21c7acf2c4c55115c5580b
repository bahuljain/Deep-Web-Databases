9 Sensual Aids Gynecologists Prescribe For Better Sex

   9 Sensual Aids Gynecologists Prescribe For Better Sex

   Intimidated by sex toys? Consider this: What you call kinky some
   gynecologists call essential. (Peyton Weikert/Stocksy)

   When was the last time you talked to your gyno about lube? Or asked
   which vibrator might help you climax easier? If the answer is “never,”
   you’re not alone — as a culture, we’re only now getting
   comfortable using these sex-cessories, much less mentioning them to our
   M.D.

   As a result, most doctors don’t prescribe the tools that have the
   potential to save women’s sex lives, instead leaving them confined to
   intimidating adult novelty stores.

   But a small band of gynecologists is hoping to change that — especially
   for the women who’d never dare walk into one of those shops. “For women
   in their 20s and 30s, the idea of buying a vibrator is no big deal,”
   said Dr. Lauren Streicher, author of [80]Love Sex Again: A Gynecologist
   Finally Fixes The Issues That Are Sabotaging Your Sex Life. But for an
   older woman — who has never considered buying a vibe or even a bottle
   of lube — hearing her doc talk about these tools can be the permission
   she needs to take the plunge. “We want patients to realize this is
   medical — this is something my doctor can help me with,” she said.

   Dysfunction

   So which sexual aids do gynecologists find themselves recommending
   again and again?

   LUBRICANTS

   Lube is widely available in supermarkets across the country, which
   means the slick stuff is probably the least intimidating of the sexual
   aids available to women. In fact, in a 2014 study in the [82]Journal of
   Sexual Medicine, 66 percent of women in a nationally representative
   sample said they’d used a sexual lubricant before, most often to make
   sex more comfortable. But here’s the thing: “Not all lubricants are
   created equal,” said Streicher. And perhaps more important, not all
   women need the same lube — depending on the reason for your dryness,
   you may require a different product.

   Try water-based lubricants for minor dryness: [83]Astroglide
   Liquid, [84]K-Y Ultragel, or [85]Sliquid Naturals H20 Intimate
   Lubricant

   Since they’re water-based, these lubes dry out faster than higher-end
   silicone products, which means they’re only suited for women with minor
   dryness. “If you’re a young woman on birth control, having a little bit
   of dryness, or maybe you’re breastfeeding, a water-based lubricant
   might be right for you,” said Dr. Leah Millheiser, an assistant
   professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Stanford School of
   Medicine. Or as Streicher said, “Some people just need a little extra
   slip, and the K-Y is going to be just fine for them.”

   Although water-based products are the least pricey of lubes, they can
   come with a cost: These tubes often contain glycerin — a sugar that
   yeast like to feed on — to keep the lube from feeling sticky, said
   Streicher. So if you’re prone to down-there infections, seek out a
   special glycerin-free water-based lube, such as Sliquid, which only
   contains five ingredients, unlike the laundry list of chemicals found
   in many supermarket products. Another worrisome ingredient to watch
   for: propylene glycol, which can cause irritation in some women, said
   Streicher.

   The good news? Water-based lubricants are compatible with condoms, as
   well as silicone sex toys.

   Try silicone lubricants for more severe dryness: [86]Pjur Eros
   Bodyglide, [87]Pink Silicone Lubricant, [88]Replens Silky Smooth
   Lubricant, or [89]Wet Platinum Premium Silicone Lubricant

   Silicone lubes are the slickest products on the shelf, making them
   ideal for women with more severe vaginal dryness, whether from
   menopause, cancer treatment, or some other condition, said Millheiser.
   They tend to be less irritating and more slippery than water-based
   products, and also last longer. “They’re just as safe as the
   water-based ones, but are a little more moisturizing,” she said.
   Although you can use them with latex condoms, silicone
   lubes will damage your silicone sex toys, so if you’re an adventurous
   couple, you may want to stick with water-based products.

   SEX TOYS

   You won’t find a study telling you which vibrator is best, which means
   you may have to engage in a little trial-and-error (fun!) to find the
   right one for you. “The one that I recommend is going to depend on
   whether someone is self-stimulating, versus in a partnered
   relationship,” said Streicher. “It very much depends on the person’s
   situation.” Here are a few reliable options to consider:

   [90][spaceball.gif]

   The Hitachi Magic Wand, a back massager for which women have found and
   alternative use. (Photo courtesy of the brand)

   [91]Hitachi Magic Wand
   “This is what we call the Cadillac of vibrators,” said Millheiser.
   First introduced in the 1970s, the Magic Wand can be used to soothe a
   sore back — but it’s also found a niche as an “intimate” massager with
   so much power that women often find they need to place a towel between
   their lady parts and the device. “The Hitachi Magic Wand is really good
   for women who are post-menopausal and who need greater stimulation to
   achieve orgasm,” Millheiser told Yahoo Health.

   Although it’s a bit clunky and has to be plugged into the wall, rather
   than running on batteries, “there are women who really love it,” said
   Millheiser. “It really makes a difference in their overall sexual
   functioning. And that in and of itself can improve self-esteem.”

   [92][spaceball.gif]

   The Jopen Intensity Kegel Exerciser let’s you get exercise down there,
   and have some fun, too! (Photo courtesy of the brand)

   [93]Jopen Intensity Kegel Exerciser
   You could do hundreds of Kegel exercises per day — or you could simply
   employ this handy gadget. Here’s [94]how it works: You inflate the
   shaft of the toy to your desired thickness (up to 3 inches), ideally so
   that it’s comfortably snug. Then coat it with electrode gel (which
   comes with it) and water-based lube, insert it into your vagina, and
   let the vibrations stimulate your PC muscles. If you want to test the
   strength of the vibrator’s settings before inserting it, tuck the
   Intensity into the crook of your elbow, an area that’s similar to the
   soft tissue inside your vagina, the manufacturers say.

   The payoff? “This device actually allows a woman to strengthen her
   pelvic floor muscles,” said Millheiser. “When you strengthen the pelvic
   floor muscles, you have the potential to increase the intensity of
   orgasm.” Training your pelvic floor can be a pleasurable process:
   During early testing of the device, one woman admitted to experiencing
   one of the best O’s of her life — and similar reports kept rolling in.
   Even if the PC-muscle stimulation doesn’t do it for you, the other
   features of the Intensity will make sure your Kegel session isn’t all
   work and no play: The device also has clitoral and G-spot vibrators,
   “so you can use it as a sex toy at the same time you’re doing your
   homework,” Millheiser said.

   [96][spaceball.gif]

   A clitoral vibe like the Lelo Lyla 2 can be used during sex to bring on
   a clitoral orgasm. (Image courtesy of the brand)

   [97]Lelo Lyla 2
   If you’ve never bought a vibe before, you may think basic dildos are
   the gold standard, since they most closely resemble a penis. “A
   well-meaning guy might get something that’s long and hard and shakes a
   lot, because he thinks that’s what women want, when in fact they really
   need clitoral stimulation,” Streicher said.

   That’s because only about 20 to 30 percent of women can actually climax
   through penetration, which makes clitoral vibrators especially handy
   for intercourse — you can can tuck one between you and your partner to
   provide the clitoral stimulation you crave, Streicher said. Clitoral
   vibes are also great for solo sessions, especially for older woman who
   have vaginal shrinkage or dryness, making penetration painful. Note:
   The Lelo Lyla 2 is a high-end option, but any bullet-shaped device will
   do the trick (you just might have to buy batteries, instead of
   recharging your toy).

   [98][spaceball.gif]

   The Vibratex Rabbit is a classic favorite — of women and gynos alike —
   for good reason. (Photo courtesy of the brand)

   [99]Vibratex Rabbit
   If you do like the sensation of girth along with your clitoral action,
   try the Rabbit — a classic toy that has beads at the base of the shaft
   for stimulation of your vaginal opening, a vibrating head, and ears to
   awaken your clitoris. “You’ll have the feeling of something in your
   vagina, and you may get some G-spot stimulation along with the external
   clitoral stimulation,” said Streicher.

   MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTS

   [100]Soul Source Vaginal Dilators
   Streicher recently saw a patient who’d been physically unable to have
   sex with her husband for two years — but thanks to dilator therapy, the
   couple was finally able to regain their former intimacy. “She actually
   cried in my office,” said Streicher. “Dilator therapy is absolutely
   essential for some women.” Dilators, which come in a range of sizes,
   are phallic-shaped — but they’re not designed for pleasure: After
   sliding one in, you leave the dilator inside your vagina for five to 15
   minutes, concentrating on letting your vaginal muscles relax around it,
   Streicher said. You repeat this process daily, and once it becomes
   comfortable, you upgrade to a larger size.

   Who should use ‘em? Dilators are designed to tackle painful sex, but if
   your discomfort is a result of dryness, you may just need lube or a
   prescription for vaginal estrogen. However, if your “vagina has either
   been shortened or made smaller, whether it’s because of tightening of
   muscles, inelastic tissue, surgery, or radiation,” dilator therapy may
   be right for you. One fairly common condition that dilators can treat:
   vaginismus, “where the muscles essentially contract down to keep the
   penis out,” said Streicher.

   There are several dilators on the market, but doctors consistently
   recommend those by Soul Source. “They’re silicone, so they can be
   boiled for sterilization, and you can put them in the freezer if you
   want them to be a bit cooler,” said Millheiser. Plus, “they’re softer
   than many of the hard plastic dilators out there.” Other good options
   include [101]Pure Romance Tapered Silicone Vaginal Dilators,[102]Cool
   Water Cones, and [103]MiddlesexMD Vaginal Dilators Kit.

   [104]Replens Long-Lasting Vaginal Moisturizer

   Doctors often prescribe vaginal estrogen cream to restore moisturize
   down below, but Replens is a non-hormonal, over-the-counter option for
   tackling dryness, said Millheiser. “Replens is the only true vaginal
   moisturizer, meaning it’s actually meant for use in the vagina,” said
   Streicher. “It is not a lubricant. It has ingredients that increase the
   moisture of the cells in the vagina. Lubricants don’t change tissue —
   they just make it more slippery.”

   Be warned: There are a number of lubes that call themselves
   moisturizers — a term probably used to make women feel more comfortable
   buying them — but if you check the ingredients, they’re no different
   from the KY’s of the world. “Replens is the only one that’s done the
   clinical trials to show that it changes the tissue,” she said.
