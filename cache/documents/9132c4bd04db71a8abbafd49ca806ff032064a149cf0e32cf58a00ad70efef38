Weight-Loss Success Story: From Couch Potato to Pro Bodybuilder

Quitting college basketball sent Jasmine Pitts' weight soaring, but she
bounced back with a kick-butt new hobby.

   At age 10, I had a 15-year plan: play basketball every day, join a
   college team and make the WNBA. But a year into undergrad, I was still
   just a walk-on, and I realized that my WNBA dreams were unrealistic
   (and my engineering degree would earn me more money). So I quit to
   focus on my studies. At the same time, I was doing what most college
   kids dopartyingand lost the [92]motivation to work out. I graduated
   in December 2011 weighing 185 pounds.
   Facebook wake-up call
   Diploma in hand, I moved to Indianapolis. Lonely in my new apartment
   and flipping through my tagged Facebook photos, I suddenly saw how big
   I'd become. I was confused: Why didn't anyone tell me? I needed to make
   a change. I got the Insanity DVDs and followed the program every night
   after work for 90 days. Then I'd cook a [93]dinner that was much
   healthier than the dining hall food of the previous four years.
   [94]Eating clean and another cycle of Insanity got me to 135 pounds by
   September 2012.

   A new lift
   I had already hit my [96]weight goal, but I wanted to [97]get stronger.
   I started lifting and quickly developed some definition. But it was my
   auntwho went from being overweight to a world-champion bodybuilderwho
   inspired me to take it seriously. In June 2014, I entered my first
   bodybuilding competition, and I placed in the top five! I've since
   competed three more times. While I'm still an engineer by day, I've
   discovered a way to live out my dreams of going proas a bodybuilder.
   Jasmine's Journey to Fit
   Jasmine relied on a winning combo of exercise and [98]better eating.

   Just add color
   I buy workout clothes in crazy colorsthey give me energy.
   Switch up your push-ups
   Create a diamond shape with your forefingers and thumbs to really
   [100]target your triceps.

   Find instant motivation
   I started listening to motivational speeches on YouTube during
   workouts. My favorite: "I Am a Champion" by Coach Flowers.
   DIY protein bars
   I make my own [102]protein bars by mixing oats with nuts or dried
   fruitwhatever sounds goodthen adding a bit of heated unsweetened
   almond milk to bind the dough before pressing it into a sheet pan (no
   baking needed).
