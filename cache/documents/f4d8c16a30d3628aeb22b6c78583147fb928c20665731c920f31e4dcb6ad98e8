   Best Answer:  There are different levels of coma stages. Most patients
   who are intubated (put on a breathing machine) are induced (put into) a
   coma. The reason for this is so that the patient does not fight against
   the breathing machine and to let their body rest so that it can
   conserve energy in order to heal. In the meantime the patient gets
   medication to treat whatever serious illness they have. Once they are
   strong enough they are brought out of the medically induced coma, the
   breathing tube is removed and they continue to heal on their own.
   If a patient is in a full coma without the aid of additional
   medications then there is nothing medicine can do to bring them out of
   the coma until the body heals itself and brings itself out of a coma.
   In the meantime they are given supportive medications to help their
   body fight and recover from whatever is ailing them.
   All comatose patients get fed through an Intravenous line or a tube
   directly in their stomach as the body cannot heal without nutrition.
   Comatose patients that are intubated will get a tracheotomy after about
   three days. What this means is that the breathing tube will enter
   through the neck area and no longer through the mouth. The reason for
   this is if it were left in the mouth it would cause irreversable
   damage. They also get a foley catheter to drain their urine and most
   likely a diaper to contain any bowel movements. Comatose patients must
   be cleaned regularly just like a baby. Comatose patients get bathed
   once or twice daily to keep there skin healthy and clean and it also
   aids in circulation. Inflatable tubes are wrapped around their legs
   that continually press and release to keep blood from pooling and
   clotting in the legs. Comatose patients are repositioned every 2 hours
   minimum to prevent skin breakdown and bedsores. Sometimes eyes are
   taped shut to prevent drying and/or eyedrops are used. All comatose
   patients are constantly monitored on heart monitors. Many time comatose
   patients have their arms lightly restrained just as a total precaution
   against them accidently pulling out all the stuff hooked to them. I
   know it seems weird but as I said there are different levels of coma.
   Just because someone is in a coma does not mean they are in a state of
   paralysis. A person not in an extremely deep coma can still mumble,
   groan and move.

       Depends on the cause of the coma. Coma can be due to electrolyte
       disturbances, brain injury, stroke, seizures, drug overdose etc.
       The cause needs to be treated and in some cases the coma may be
       reversed. While the patient is comatose they require complete care
       as they cannot do anything for themselves. They will be on a
       ventilator to help them breath, a tube in the stomach for feedings,
       a catheter for urine, constant nursing care for positioning to
       prevent bed sores and muscle contractures.
