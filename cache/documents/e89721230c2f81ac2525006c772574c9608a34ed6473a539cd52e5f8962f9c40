      It is well recognized that the most frequent chronic complication of
      diabetes is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ([1]1,[2]2).
      Dyslipoproteinemias are among the many potential risk factors that may
      account for this. The term dyslipoproteinemia is used rather than
      hyperlipoproteinemia because in diabetes there may be changes in both
      the quantity and the quality of the lipoproteins. One of the earliest
      suggestions that lipid abnormalities may be responsible for
      atherosclerosis in diabetes was voiced by E.P. Joslin: "With fat
      diabetes begins. From fat diabetics die, formerly of coma recently of
      arteriosclerosis" ([3]3). This article reviews some of the evidence
      relating dyslipoproteinemias to atherosclerosis in diabetes that has
      emerged since that assertion 70 years ago.

      Recognizing that feeding fat to rabbits resulted in the development of
      atheromatous lesions, Duff and McMillan ([4]4) reasoned that feeding
      similar fat loads to alloxan-diabetic rabbits would produce even more
      atheromata. However, when they conducted that experiment almost 50
      years ago, they found just the oppositeless atherosclerosis in the
      diabetic animals ([5]4). They did not recognize at that time that the
      activity of lipoprotein lipase is greatly reduced in diabetic rabbits.
      Therefore, the massive hyperlipidemia that they produced was due to an
      increase in chylomicrons. More recent studies, summarized later,
      indicate that the small triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, not the
      chylomicrons, are associated with the increase in atherosclerosis.

      LIPOPROTEIN ABNORMALITIES IN DIABETES Most groups that have quantified
      the lipoproteins in diabetes have found that the major abnormality is
      hypertriglyceridemia ([6]5[7]8). The levels of cholesterol and LDL in
      diabetic patients are generally found to be similar to those in the
      general population. However, a few studies suggest that LDL decreases
      with short-term tight glycemic control ([8]9). HDL levels have been
      noted in different studies to be reduced, normal, or elevated. This
      probably reflects the nature of the hypoglycemic agent used by the
      patient and the presence or absence of the hypertriglyceridemia of
      obesity and of other disorders, such as nephropathy. A recent report of
      the UK Prospective Diabetes Study population indicates that these
      abnormalities are already found in type 2 diabetes at the time of
      diagnosis ([9]10). In fact, they have been noted in individuals who are
      normoglycemic but later develop diabetes ([10]11).

      The last observation is consistent with those studies suggesting that
      hypertriglyceridemia is a part of the insulin resistance syndrome
      ([11]12). Some years ago, using tracer kinetic methods, we found that
      hypertriglyceridemia was associated with insulin resistance, even in
      men selected to be lean ([12]13). We then observed that reducing plasma
      triglyceride levels with gemfibrozil in a group of normoglycemic people
      did not change their glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test but
      did reduce their serum levels of insulin ([13]14). This indirectly
      suggested that insulin resistance was directly related to plasma
      triglyceride levels. Using hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp methodology,
      similar conclusions were reached in those with type 2 diabetes in fair
      control (fasting glucose >9 mmol/l), but not in those who had better
      glycemic control ([14]15). Studies conducted by Vuorinen-Markkola et
      al. ([15]16) did not find a similar improvement in insulin sensitivity.
      The discrepancy may result from the fact that the first studies
      produced changes from levels above to levels below 1.5 mmol/l. However,
      the third study did not reduce triglyceride levels below that apparent
      threshold.

      CHOLESTEROL AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN DIABETES The similarity of
      plasma cholesterol levels in those with and those without diabetes
      should not lead one to conclude that cholesterol has no coronary risk
      effect in diabetes. Recently, the Multiple Risk Factor Trial published
      its data on those with diabetes ([16]17). The incidence of coronary
      mortality increased in a curvilinear manner, with increasing
      concentrations of serum cholesterol both in those with and in those
      without diabetes. The two curves were of similar shape but differed,
      with the curve for those with diabetes being higher than the curve for
      those without. At any given serum cholesterol concentration, those with
      diabetes had a risk of coronary artery disease mortality between two
      and four times greater than the risk in those without diabetes. There
      may be several reasons for this. First, the level of cholesterol in the
      serum reflects the level of all lipoproteins, not just LDL. Thus, an
      elevation of serum cholesterol may, in part, indicate an increase in
      the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Second, there may be many
      nonlipoprotein atherogenic factors in those with diabetes that could
      increase the "basal" risk of coronary artery disease. These include the
      presence of advanced glycation end products ([17]18), the presence of
      nephropathy ([18]19), the presence of hypertension ([19]20), and
      changes in coagulation factors and platelets ([20]21), to name but a
      few. An elevation of cholesterol would then add to these. Third, LDL
      may be modified in a way that would make any given amount of it more
      atherogenic. Such modifications would include nonenzymatic glycation
      ([21]22), oxidation ([22]23), and a shift toward smaller and denser
      particles ([23]24).

      TRIGLYCERIDES AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN DIABETES As noted
      earlier, the most frequent quantitative abnormality in lipoproteins in
      diabetes is hypertriglyceridemia. There is increasing support for the
      concept that hypertriglyceridemia confers an increased risk for
      coronary artery disease in the general population ([24]25). This is
      clearly recognized in univariate studies. However, meta-analysis of
      prospective studies also suggests that the risk effect of
      hypertriglyceridemia is independent of HDL ([25]25). Thus, probably
      both hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of HDL, not either one alone,
      contribute to coronary risk.

      The data in those with diabetes are more restricted. An early
      suggestion of an association came from the World Health Organization
      Multinational Study, which found a cross-sectional association of
      ischemic electrocardiogram changes with hypertriglyceridemia ([26]26).
      More recently, the Paris Prospective Study observed that in men with
      diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, coronary artery disease death
      was associated with an increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations
      ([27]27). Unfortunately, that study did not report HDL levels. Another
      prospective study from Kuopio, Finland, indicated that atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease was associated with both an increase in
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and a decrease in HDL ([28]28).

      TRIGLYCERIDE-RICH LIPOPROTEIN PARTICLES AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN
      DIABETES The triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles extend across a
      broad range of size and density. We have made use of the observations
      that each particle of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein contains one
      molecule of apolipoprotein B. This permitted an estimate of the numbers
      of particles by measuring the amount of apolipoprotein B in a given
      sample. In both those with diabetes ([29]29) and those without diabetes
      ([30]30), we found that three-fourths of the triglyceride-rich
      lipoprotein particles are in the smaller denser (Sf 1260) subfraction,
      a subfraction that has been called intermediate-density lipoprotein
      (IDL) by us and some others. Furthermore, 70% of the differences in
      plasma triglyceride concentrations in a population can be explained by
      a difference in particle number rather than in particle size. Almost 50
      years ago, Jones et al. ([31]31) found that IDL levels were higher in
      male myocardial infarct survivors than in control subjects and that IDL
      levels predicted those who were likely to reinfarct. We found that IDL
      particle numbers and triglyceride content were both associated with
      coronary artery disease in men without diabetes and that this
      association was independent of both LDL and HDL ([32]32). Reardon et
      al. ([33]33) found that IDL levels correlated with the severity of
      angiographically evaluated coronary artery disease in women without
      diabetes. In a recent study of men and women with type 2 diabetes, we
      observed that triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle numbers were
      increased in those who had moderate coronary artery disease on
      angiography compared with those who had only mild disease ([34]34).
      Multivariate analysis showed that age, low HDL, and sex were also
      related to coronary artery disease severity, but these were independent
      of each other and of the number of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
      particles. Interestingly, there was no further increase in particle
      numbers between those with moderate and those with severe disease. This
      raises the intriguing and as-yet-untested possibility that
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins might be more related to the early
      stages of atherogenesis and that other factors might have more
      influence on the later stages.

      INTERVENTION STUDIES Although a number of trials have examined the
      effect on coronary disease of correcting dyslipoproteinemias
      ([35]33[36]41), none that have been completed have specifically
      addressed the question in those with diabetes. Three of the published
      clinical trials have included some individuals with diabetes in their
      study population and have conducted a post hoc analysis of the data
      obtained from that subgroup. The first, the Helsinki Heart Study, was a
      primary prevention trial. Its diabetic subpopulation was too small to
      show a statistical difference. However, there was a trend in those with
      diabetes who were treated with gemfibrozil toward a reduction in
      coronary events ([37]42). The second was the Scandinavian Simvastatin
      Survival Study (4S). A secondary intervention study demonstrated that
      treatment of hypercholesterolemic individuals with simvastatin reduced
      coronary events and total mortality ([38]35). In the post hoc analysis
      of the diabetic subpopulation, there were also fewer coronary events,
      but there was no reduction in mortality ([39]43). In addition to the
      problems inherent in a post hoc subgroup analysis, those with diabetes
      in this population probably were not representative of the general
      diabetic population in the participating countries. Four percent of the
      4S population had diabetes. This is about one-fourth the prevalence of
      diabetes in similarly aged people in those countries. Probably this is
      because of the exclusion criteria for the study. Among many of these
      criteria was the exclusion of those with a serum triglyceride >2.5
      mmol/l. The post hoc analysis of the diabetic population in a similar
      study that used pravastatin, the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events
      (CARE) Study ([40]39), led to similar conclusions. Unfortunately,
      insufficient information is published about its diabetic subpopulation
      to be able to draw further conclusions. However, within the limitations
      of a post hoc analysis of secondary intervention studies in
      hypercholesterolemic populations treated with statins, both suggest
      that reducing hypercholesterolemia will reduce the risk of recurrence
      of coronary disease. Recently, the Veteran's Administration HDL
      Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) Study presented data indicating that
      treating those with low HDL but normal LDL levels with gemfibrozil
      resulted in a significant reduction in fatal and nonfatal coronary
      events and strokes ([41]44). Those with diabetes within the VA-HIT
      population had a very strong, but not quite significant, trend toward a
      similar benefit in clinical events. The recently completed St. Mary's,
      Ealing, Northwick Park Diabetes Cardiovascular Prevention (SENDCAP)
      Study was designed to examine the effects of bezafibrate on carotid
      artery intima-media thickness in those with type 2 diabetes. No effect
      was found. However, there was a reduction in the number of people who
      had electrocardiogram-defined probable ischemia or myocardial
      infarction ([42]45).

      Some studies have now started with the primary a priori aim of
      determining whether lipid reduction in type 2 diabetes will result in
      less coronary atherosclerosis. The first of these is the Diabetes
      Atherosclerosis Intervention Study ([43]46). It is an angiographic
      study examining whether correcting dyslipoproteinemia in men and women
      with type 2 diabetes with micronized fenofibrate will alter the rate of
      progression or regression of their coronary artery disease. The
      protocol for this study has been published ([44]44). It is due for
      completion at some point in 1999. Other studies are designed to
      evaluate clinical events as their primary endpoint. They are in their
      early stages of recruitment and have not yet published their protocols.
      They include the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in
      Diabetes (FIELD) Study, a study using fenofibrate in those with type 2
      diabetes who have triglycerides >1.0 mmol/l and a total cholesterol
      <5.5 mmol/l if there is coronary disease and <6.5 mmol/l if there is
      not (A. Keech, personal communication). Another is the Lipids in
      Diabetes Study (LDS), which is examining 4,000 men and women who will
      be treated with micronized fenofibrate, cerivastatin, both, or neither
      (R. R. Holman, personal communication). Finally, the Collaborative
      Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) is examining the effects of
      treating with atorvastatin 2,120 people with type 2 diabetes who have
      no clinical coronary disease, an LDL cholesterol <4.14 mmol/l, and
      triglycerides <6.78 mmol/l (D.J. Betteridge, personal communication).

      CONCLUSIONS At this time, there is no direct information to indicate
      whether treating the hyperlipidemia of diabetes will or will not be
      beneficial in terms of coronary disease. However, inference from
      pathophysiological information and extrapolation from post hoc analyses
      support the treatment of hyperlipidemia where it exists in diabetes.
      The treatment regimens should optimize glycemic control and use diet
      and lifestyle modifications, as well as drug therapy directed to the
      specific lipoprotein disorder that is present.
