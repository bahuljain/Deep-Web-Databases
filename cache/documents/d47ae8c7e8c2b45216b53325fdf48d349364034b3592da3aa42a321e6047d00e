   As far as I know, I have most of the codecs on my pc because I've
   installed k-lite codec pack. I opened it using GSpot to check what type
   of file it really is, and under Codec it indicated n.a. , and under
   Type it indicated video/x-ms-asf
   What do I do?
   By the way, if I open it with windows media player, the internet
   explorer automatically opens and instructs me to download a codec,
   which turns out to be a trojan.

   Best Answer:  Sounds to me that you have a bad avi file, it is possible
   it was encoded with other unfamiliar formats that k-lite does not
   support. My guess is that whomever had made that avi file, used a nifty
   lil program to insert his/her own custom protection license to the
   file, which when played in windows media player, automatically opens up
   the developers license page(the codec thingy you were talking about)
   try playing it in gom player, if it still doesnt play, this file, is im
   sorry to say, a fake...
   be more careful with what you download round the net
   =P
   best wishes
