   “Aging is really hard, and it’s tough,” said actress Bo Derek (58 and
   still pretty damn stunning, by the way) in a candid interview with[99]
   CBS News Sunday Morning recently. “Bette Davis was right; it’s not for
   sissies, it really isn’t.”

   OK, plucking stray grays, letting out an earth-shattering groan when
   you get out of bed in the morning, or opening up an envelop and
   finding an AARP card staring you flat in the face (seriously—WTF?) is
   nobody’s idea of fun. But the next time you find yourself bemoaning the
   DOB on your driver’s license, know this: There is some great stuff that
   comes with growing old (really). No, really.

   Here, 10 celebs—39 years of age and counting—offer up valid reasons to
   embrace the age you’re at, and look forward to the things to come.
   (Smokin’ sex? Hey, thanks for the heads-up, Lauren Hutton!)

   Bottom line: If you think that life is good now, honey, just wait until
   you get a load of tomorrow.

    You’ve (finally) got it all figured out…

   “I’ve had more fun post-40 than I can remember. From a work point of
   view, a physical point of view, a psychotherapeutic point of view.”

   —Jennifer Aniston, 46, [100]Harper’s Bazaar

   “It’s an old cliche, but you really do get better as you age. I wish I
   had the body and the face of that twenty-year-old. I’m so glad I don’t
   have her brain. I feel, not necessarily smarter, but more settled and
   informed than when I was that age. Everything was about “What do people
   think of me?” Now I’m calmer. Hopefully, I’ve gotten a little more
   grace.”

   —Valerie Bertinelli, 55, [101]Prevention

   RELATED: [102]15 Ways Exercise Makes You Look and Feel Younger

   You’re alive—and most definitely kicking…

   “I realize I’m blessed to even be in the position to age. To age is a
   privilege, not a birthright, even though most of us in the civilized
   world seem to forget this.”

   —Paulinka Porizkova, 50, [103]Huffington Post

   “I’m very f*cking grateful to be alive. I have so many friends who are
   sick or gone, and I’m here. Are you kidding? No complaints!”

   —Meryl Streep, 65, [104]Vanity Fair

   You can ditch the WonderBra…

   “Losing your sex appeal is no bad thing. People look at me in a way
   that is not as immediately sexual as they did when I was young. I find
   that liberating. You can operate on a different level, without having
   to contend with that dynamic all the time.”

   —Elizabeth McGovern, 53, [105]The London Times

   You’re even more of a babe (if that’s possible)…

   “As you get older, you get better at so many things. My friends who are
   older than me—which is most of them—are a lot more caustic than they
   used to be. But a lot of them only became great when they turned 40.
   Everything is a little bit sexier when you’re older. You’re sexier.
   You’re more confident. You can do what you want.”

   —Chelsea Handler, 40, [106]Harper’s Bazaar

   You’ve got confidence is spades…

   “I feel better now than I’ve ever felt. I look at pictures of myself
   when I was younger and I think, ‘God, I was so gorgeous there, but I
   didn’t feel it.’ Or, ‘Wow, I look so much better now.’ I was such a
   dork and I can see insecurity written all over my face, trying to be
   something I wasn’t – even though at the time I thought I was cool.”

   —Elle Macpherson, 51, [107]The Telegraph

   You get better compliments…

   “The overriding, positive thing about turning 50 is that you go from
   ‘You don’t look your age’ to ‘You look pretty darn good for your age.’
   There’s this tremendous pressure off—you deserve to have a wrinkle, you
   deserve to have a little pooch on your tummy.”

   —Michelle Pfeiffer, 57, [108]InStyle

   You can be as, um, eccentric as you want…

   “People can get crazier as they get older. I can just be weird whenever
   I want, and there’s the freedom of not caring what people think.”

   —Candice Bergen, 69, [109]AARP

   RELATED: [110]15 Eating Habits That Make You Live Longer

   You can throw around the F-word, with authority…

   “I don’t often wish that I’m younger because I think that it’s pretty
   cool to be older. What I love the most about being older is that lovely
   I don’t give a f–kness kind of thing.”

   —Helen Mirren, 69, 2014 [111]pre-Oscar party speech

   You and your snobby high school prom queen now have something in
   common..

   “I take comfort that aging happens to everybody. It’s part of life.
   Yes, it bothers me when I have lines or puffiness or droops. But it
   connects me with the human race. Just like the weather is the great
   equalizer, so is aging.”

   —Diane Lane, 50, [112]More

   You’re a survivor, and you’ve got the scars (and a lot of great
   stories) to prove it…

   “My 40s were pretty great, but now, in my 50s…there comes this
   wonderful self-knowledge. You’re not trying to be somebody else, or do
   something else with your life. You think: Here I am. I’ve gone through
   this, I’ve survived that, and I know who I am now.”

   —Kim Cattrall, 58, [113]Good Houskeeping

   You can stop apologizing…

   “Getting older. It’s like, ‘Yeah, this is who I am, f— off.’ As opposed
   to, ‘This is who I am, I’m sorry.’ You know, there’s something about
   getting older and owning who you are that is a good thing.”

   —Julia Louis-Dreyfus, 54, [114]Health

   You can finally (aaah) relax…

   “I was always in a rush. I felt like time was going to run out. Now
   that I’m older, I know I’m not missing out on anything. Now, I go home,
   and that feels really good. When I hit 30, I realized I didn’t have to
   please everybody. I could actually enjoy life, which is not a bad thing
   at all.”

   —Charlize Theron, 39, [115]W Magazine

   RELATED: [116]A Meditation to Ease Your Anxiety

   You’re more resilient…

   “When I was in my 20s I wasn’t sure of myself. Now I can really
   stretch. I don’t have to stay in the box. At this point I can say to
   myself, So what if I fall, so what? I’m going to get back up.”

   —Jennifer Lopez, 45,[117] InStyle

   Now you can really rock a swimsuit. And if you can’t? Who cares?

   “I feel more in proportion now than I was when I was 20, so I feel
   better in a bathing suit now than I did before I had kids. But I think
   one of the most beautiful things about growing up is this
   self-acceptance that starts to happen.”

   —Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, [118]People

   Did we mention the hotter sex thing?

   “I actually have better sex — which is the bottom line, is it not? …
   Because you learn how to, you know, work the vehicle better.”

   —Lauren Hutton, 71, [119]Artisan News
