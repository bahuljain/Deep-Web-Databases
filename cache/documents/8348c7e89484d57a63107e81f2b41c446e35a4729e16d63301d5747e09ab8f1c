   Best Answer:  The goal is to eat a 1:1:1 ratio for breakfast, lunch,
   and dinner. This means that 3 times a day you will eat one serving of a
   fast carb, one serving of a slow carb, and one serving of protein. It's
   all about keeping your meals balanced.
   Slow Carbs: Veggies, Beans, and low sugar fruits (artichokes,
   asparagus, bell peppers, cauliflower, broccoli, cucumbers, mushrooms,
   summer squash, zucchinni, legumes, tomatoes, berries, grapefruit,
   lemons, limes, etc.)
   Fast Carbs: Grains and most fruit (pasta, oatmeal, bread, corn, rice,
   winter squash, melon, cherries, nectarines, grapes, milk, etc.)
   Protein: Meats and Nuts
   A serving of fruit/veggies = 1/2 cup (except for lettuce, spinach
   that's a full cup)
   A serving of meat = 4 oz
   A serving of nuts = 1-2 oz (about a handful)
   A serving of bread = one slice
   Serving sizes for packaged foods are listed on the package.
   Aside from those three meals, you should eat snacks in-between them.
   You can pick anything you want (even junk foods), just make sure you're
   not consuming it too closely (2 hrs) to your other meals (otherwise
   your fast carb ratio will be out of balance); as long as your snack
   doesn't exceed 45 carbs & 200 calories, your body will not be prompted
   to release insulin and will burn the sugar as energy.

       Exercise or no exercise you won't be able to lose the weight if you
       don't cut your food intake but we all know that's pretty hard,
       right? A good appetite suppressant can help you out big time but it
       has to be natural or you can get into serious heath problems.
       I've lost 30 lbs in 2 months by using Miracle Garcinia Cambogia
       (FDA approved 100% natural). In my first month 20 and then 10 the
       second month. I was an emotional eater and these supplements
       changed my life. They act like an appetite suppressant so I didn't
       feel like eating anymore. Not hungry anymore -> Lower calories ->
       Lose weight, simple as that. I did no exercises just 30 minutes
       walks 5 days a week.
       It's been 3 months since I lost the weight and I did not gain any
       pounds back, actually I lost another 2 lbs. If you want to take a
       look here is a website where you can find discounts:
       http://www.miraclegarciniapromo.com I got them 30% off from here.
       Hope this helps!

       If you can be pregnant or if you have infertility problems I
       reccomend to follow this method http://pregnancy.toptips.org
       Many factors can cause a couple trouble in conceiving a baby, I'll
       list a few of the most common ones in women:
       Anorexia or other dietary dysfunctions
       Lacking amounts of FSH and LH are produced, so ovaries aren't as
       functional as they could be, and so not many eggs are produced
       Stress, causing periods to become irregular
       Medications such as cancer treatments,antidepressants, hormone
       therapy, pain killers, and antipsychotic drugs can all cause
       temporary infertility.
       With the method that I posted above you will be able to get
       pregnant!
