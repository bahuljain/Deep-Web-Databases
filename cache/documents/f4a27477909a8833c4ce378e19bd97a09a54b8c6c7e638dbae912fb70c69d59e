       You can test after a month and then 3 months post exposure for a
       conclusive result. The chances of you getting HIV this way are very
       low, it would only happen if you have large open sores in your
       mouth. He didn't ejaculate inside, which is a good point. Test for
       a peace of mind, and do not engage in other sexual activities with
       strangers.

       Your chances of contracting HIV through oral sex are slim to
       non-existent. Maybe you should take this as a lesson though, don't
       have unsafe sex with random strangers.

       Low but not zero.
       As usual every time you have a new partner - Get tested at months
       0,3,4,9,12. If you have another new partner keep extending the
       quarterly testing pattern until you have been tested 12+ months
       after any new partner. This standard for testing does not matter if
       you are straight, bi or gay but it is even more important if you
       have not been there sharing the results of the test before doing
       acts.

       It's lower then when having intercourse but it's not zero.
       See a doctor, be honest about what happened and talk to them about
       getting tested for HIV.

       Unknown. You need to get tested now and again in six months. By the
       way, he committed a criminal act by lying to you.
