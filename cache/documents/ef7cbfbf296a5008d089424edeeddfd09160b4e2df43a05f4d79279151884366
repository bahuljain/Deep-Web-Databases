LeBron's Low-Carb Diet

   [75]DetailsSeptember 26, 2014

   Why athletes are turning away from carbs, and should you be doing the
   same?

   By K. Aleisha Fetters

   LeBron ºs Low-Carb Diet

   REMEMBER THE DAYS when we all wanted to ‚ÄúBe like Mike‚Äù and fill up on
   carb-filled Gatorade between quarters? Well, times change, and now
   everyone is talking about LeBron James‚Äô low-carb ketosis diet, inspired
   by his recent Instagram posts.

   A metabolic state in which the body uses fat as a source of energy
   instead of glycogen (the body‚Äôs stored form of carbohydrates found in
   the muscle and liver), ketosis practically guarantees weight loss. And
   it‚Äôs apparent that LeBron James‚Äô 6‚Äô8‚Äù frame has gotten a lot
   leaner‚Äîand, at least he hopes, meaner, per a recent article
   in [76]Sports Illustrated.

   But how do you get the body to run on fat when nature intended for it
   to run on carbs? Basically, see how low you can go with your carb
   intake. When you do, the body‚Äôs glycogen eventually runs out, and the
   body reacts by breaking down fat to produce ketones, carbon fragments
   which can then be used for energy, explains health and
   fitness-certified specialist, Jim White, R.D., owner of [77]Jim White
   Fitness & Nutrition Studios and a spokesperson for the [78]Academy of
   Nutrition and Dietetics. Most guys have to eat 100 grams or less of
   carbs per day before their pee sticks (yep, you read that right) read
   positive for ketosis.

   Problem is, ketones are nasty little buggars. They turn the blood
   acidic and cause horribly bad breath, nausea, and decreased appetite
   (which some people might see as a pro). Plus, if the body‚Äôs ketone
   levels get too high, they can prove toxic to the kidneys and liver,
   White says. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to complete any ketosis diet
   with the supervision of a doctor.

   "I‚Äôve run on a low-carb diet and it is really miserable," White says.
   "Does it cause weight loss? Absolutely, you‚Äôre going to lose weight on
   this diet. Anybody can lose weight if they put themselves in starvation
   state. I don‚Äôt see vast improvements in performance. However, losing
   weight‚Äîif you have it to lose‚Äîcan theoretically improve speed and
   agility."

   What‚Äôs more, besides fueling your muscles, ketones can fuel your
   brain‚Äîan organ that‚Äôs designed to get 90 percent of its food-fuel from
   carbs, White says. Enter, brain fog and a really crappy mood.

   And last but not least, low-carb diets make dehydration‚Äîwhich is
   already a major threat to athletes‚Äîmuch more likely. Every gram of
   glycogen in your body comes with a few grams of water. So, while you
   will carry less water weight when you‚Äôre on a low-carb diet, it‚Äôs
   easier to slip into dehydration mode. And water losses totaling just
   one percent of your body weight can impair exercise performance, not to
   mention physiological function, according to research published in
   the [79]Journal of Athletic Training.

   So, no matter how LeBron‚Äôs ketosis diet plays out with Cleveland, it
   may not be something you should try.

   White recommends the average gym-going guy get about 55 percent of his
   calories from carbs. If you‚Äôre aggressively trying to lose weight, it
   won‚Äôt hurt to cut that down to about 40 percent, but he doesn‚Äôt advise
   eating less than 125 grams of carbs a day‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre
   physically active.

   Just make sure the vast majority (if not all) of those grams come from
   good-for-you sources like fruits, veggies, and whole grains. No matter
   how many carbs you do or don‚Äôt eat, you don‚Äôt need any of them to be
   from soda or candy bars, he says. But you already knew that, right?
