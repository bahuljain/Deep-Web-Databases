   Best Answer:  A calorie is a calorie. It doesn't matter if it comes
   from fat, protein, or carbs. When it comes down to it, all calories are
   the same. However, there are good calories and empty ones.
   Running, walking, swimming, and biking are great exercises to burn fat.

       The body is a complicated machine. It's been shown that a fat
       calorie is inherently more likely to be stored as fat. BUT, that
       doesn't mean that fat calories are bad. Depending on what you eat
       those fat calories with. When you eat them. These matter more.
       Lets say you eat a high fat/high carb dinner, say linguine and
       sausage. The body will burn the carbs first. And chances are, if
       you are the normal semi-sedentary American, you aren't burning
       enough of the carb calories for the body to even reach those fat
       calories. So not only is the body converting those extra carb
       calories to fat, now you are adding on all those calories from the
       protein AND fat from the sausage to the surplus calories to what
       your body is turning into fat. (Minus the calories burned through
       the thermic effect but that's a whole different equation).
       Basically you need to eat carbs when your body needs them most.
       When you wake up first thing. Your body has been starved for 6-8
       hours (why they call it break-the-fast). And post workout, when
       you've depleted your glycogen (what the body converts carbs into,
       in a very simplified way).
       Follow this fairly simple plan don't mix carbs and fat. Eat either
       a carb/protein meal (in the morning and after you exercise) or a
       fat/protein meal (all the other meals in your day) and never a
       fat/carb meal.
       And research the thermic effect. It will explain how "a calorie is
       a calorie" is not true.
       If I eat 100 calories of rice and you eat 100 calories of steak,
       the end result isn't the same. You will burn way more calories
       simply digesting your protein than I will digesting my carbs.
       Meaning you burn up to 20% more calories doing nothing other than
       just digesting your food. Let alone jumping on the elliptical.

       Taking in more calories than your body needs makes you gain weight,
       it doesn't matter where the calories come from. You take in most of
       your calories by eating fats, proteins, and carbohydrates which are
       then turned into energy for your body's cells. Excess calories are
       stored as fat.
       The type of exercise you do does not matter as much as that you do
       exercise. Try to fit in an hour most days of the week. Do something
       you enjoy, you'll be more likely to stick with it.
       Also look at the new food guide pyramid and guidelines, you can put
       in your info and find out exactly how much of what you should be
       eating. [123]http://mypyramid.gov

       Fat doesn't make you fat. Excess calories of ANY kind are stored as
       fat. You can theoretically eat a no-fat diet and still get fat if
       you eat more calories than your body needs. You can't "attack fat
       calories." When you exercise, your body first burns glycogen for
       about the first 20 minutes. After that it starts to burn fat. I'd
       recommend 45-60 minutes of cardio a few times a week to burn fat.
       Then do resistance training (weight lifting, crunches, pushups,
       etc.) to tone muscles.

       A calorie needs to be used after it is eaten. If thhe carie isn't
       use our bodies store the extra calories. Any exercise will help.
       The more calories you want to burn up, exercise harder and longer.
       And eating less calories will help. Eat whole , real foods, not so
       much processed food.

       1 g of pure carbohydrate yields about 4 Calories of energy, and the
       recommended intake for an adult person is about 2,000 - 2,500
       Calories/day. It is alternatively referred to as Calorie (Cal),
       kilocalorie (kcal) or even calorie with lowercase 'c'. The
       potential for confusion can be avoided by using the SI units
       (joules or kilojoules).

       FOOD ENERGY! :) That's what we need, especially in the winter time
       when we don't get enough sunlight (or photosynthesis). We need it
       to be healthy, strong and happy!
