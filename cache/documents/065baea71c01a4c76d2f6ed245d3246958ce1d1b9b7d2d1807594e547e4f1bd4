   Best Answer:  okay, here is the first function. i wrote a print
   function that prints the elements and also a little bit of code in the
   main function to test my code. feel free to ignore those.
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstdlib> // For srand() and rand()
   using std::cout;
   using std::endl;
   int getMax(int array[])
   {
   int length = 100000;
   int max = array[0];
   for(int i = 1; i<length; i++)
   {
   if(array[i] > max)
   max = array[i];
   }
   return max;
   }
   int getMin(int array[])
   {
   int length = 100000;
   int min = array[0];
   for(int i = 1; i<length; i++)
   {
   if(array[i] < min)
   min = array[i];
   }
   return min;
   }
   // this functions populates and returns an array of 10000 elements and
   // stores the max and min of the array in the two passed arguments
   int * functionOne( int &min, int &max)
   {
   int *array = new int[100000];
   for ( int i=0; i < 100000; i++)
   {
   array[i] = rand();
   }
   min = getMin(array);
   max = getMax(array);
   return array;
   }
   void print( int * array)
   {
   for ( int i=0; i < 100000; i++)
   {
   cout << array[i] << endl ;
   }
   }
   int main(void){
   int min;
   int max;
   int *array=functionOne(min, max);
   print(array);
   cout << "min: " << min;
   cout<< "\n";
   cout << "max:" << max;
   }
   for part two of your question you basically need to
   1) #include <cstdlib>
   2)
   int array[100];
   for ( int i =0; i < 100; i++)
   {
   array[i] = (rand() % 10) + 1;
   }

       By answering this for you, I am doing you a disservice, since if
       you can't do this, you have no business passing any kind of
       programming course. I encourage you to attend lectures, and if you
       don't understand, seek help. The internet is a wonderful resource.
       Here we go.

       #include <iostream>

       // That's all there is to it! Have fun on the exam.
       return 0;
       }
       void readArray(int arr[], int& max, int& min) {
       // Local vars
       int tempMax = 0;
       int tempMin = 0;
       // Loop through the array
       for (int i = 0; i < 99999; i++) {
       cin >> arr[i];
       if (arr[i] > tempMax) tempMax = arr[i];
       if (arr[i] < tempMin) tempMin = arr[i];
       }
       // Assign the variables that were passed by reference
       max = tempMax;
       min = tempMin;
