   You’ve likely heard about the [98]tragic death of Dave Goldberg, the
   Survey Monkey CEO (and husband of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg), who
   collapsed in the gym at a private villa at the Four Seasons Resort in
   Punta Mita, Mexico, on Friday.

   It’s believed that Goldberg fell off a treadmill: The New York Times
   reported that his brother Robert found him on the floor of the gym with
   blood around him. He was transported to a hospital where he later died
   of [99]head trauma and blood loss, according to a spokesman for the
   local prosecutor’s office.

   Although [100]treadmills are generally safe, accidents can happen. In
   2013, about 24,000 [101]treadmill-related injuries required emergency
   medical care, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s
   injury surveillance system. And they are not for children; at-home
   exercise equipment injured about 20,000 kids under 18 in 2009, the same
   year Mike Tyson’s 4-year-old daughter was [102]killed in a treadmill
   accident.

   Protect yourself with these strategies.

Use the safety catch

   Most treadmills have one: a string that attaches you to the
   [103]treadmill so that, if you fall, the string will bring the machine
   to a stop. At the very least, know where the kill switch is, so you can
   press it immediately if you start to slip, says Amie Hoff, a fitness
   expert in New York City.

Put loose objects in their place

   If you have anything on the treadmill, such as a water bottle or an
   iPod, make sure it’s in a stable spot so it doesn’t bounce off and make
   you trip, Hoff says.

Let it go

   People who fall tend to panic and grab the handrail while the belt is
   running, says David Siik, creator of [106]Precision Running for Equinox
   and a running coach in Los Angeles. That can lead to scrapes and
   banged-up knees, as well as muscle strain in your arms. Instead, let go
   and scoot off the back.

   RELATED: [107]3 Mistakes You’re Making at the Gym

Make some space

   If you use a treadmill at home, don’t cram it into a tight corner,
   where you’d get more banged up if you fell, Siik says. At the gym,
   bypass a treadmill that fits right up against a wall.
