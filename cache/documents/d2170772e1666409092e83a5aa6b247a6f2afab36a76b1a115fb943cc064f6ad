How do I obtain the source code of a Java applet?

   I desperately need to have a look at the source code of the Java applet
   on http://www.open.ou.nl/eyn/applets/magicsq.htm for a school project.
   I can't find a way to download it though. I found out in the source
   code these few lines: <p><applet code="MagischVierkantApplet.class"...

   Best Answer:  The Class file is not the source code, as you're aware,
   you need to request the source code .java files from the author.
   Optionally, you can try a java decompiler, which takes the .class file
   and recreates the source (although not always 100% effective)

       Go ahead and save the .class file from the web page. Then get your
       hands on a java decompiler. I forget the have of the one I have but
       i know there are a few out there. The only draw back to decompiling
       is if the class file is obfuscated it will be very hard to follow
       the code.
