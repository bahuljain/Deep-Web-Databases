You're Doing Squats Wrong

   [79]Women's HealthJuly 14, 2014

   You ºre Doing Squats Wrong
   By K. Aleisha Fetters

   Squats are one of the best exercises for a stronger, fitter you‚Äîbut
   only if you do them right. So before you crank out another rep, make
   sure your squats aren‚Äôt falling victim to these all-too-common
   mistakes:

   Letting Your Knees Fall In
   A combination of wide hips and weak inner and outer thighs makes this
   mistake pretty much ubiquitous among women. Unfortunately, when your
   knees move in toward each other during a squat, it can put undue
   pressure on your knee ligaments, resulting in injury, says exercise
   physiologist Marta Montenegro, C.S.C.S. But correcting this mistake
   isn‚Äôt as simple as willing your knees into place. You need to
   strengthen your inner and (especially) outer thighs, she says. These
   [81]lateral band walks are a great way to do just that.
   Not Lowering to 90 Degrees
   If you don‚Äôt complete the exercise through its full range of motion‚Äîall
   the way down until your thighbone is parallel with the floor‚Äîyou won‚Äôt
   fully engage your glutes and the upper part of your hamstrings, says
   Montenegro. Basically, you won‚Äôt get a better butt. To train your body
   to complete the entire move, try practicing some squats in front of a
   knee-high box or step. Lower your body until your butt just barely
   touches the box, and then push back up.

   Arching Your Back
   Your back naturally has a slight ‚ÄúS‚Äù to it. If you don‚Äôt have enough
   lower back strength‚Äîand many women don‚Äôt‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to add some extra
   arch while squatting. The problem: That dumps the weight into your
   lower back and means you risk injury, says Montenegro. To shore up your
   lower-back strength, try performing this [83]dumbbell straight-leg
   deadlift.

   Doing the Same Squat Over and Over
   If you aren‚Äôt regularly switching up your foot positions, you aren‚Äôt
   taking advantage of what a versatile exercise the squat really is, says
   Montenegro. For instance, if you stand with your feet closer than
   shoulder-width apart, you‚Äôll target your glutes. Take a wide stance,
   and you‚Äôll work those hard-to-tone inner thighs. Move one leg forward a
   bit, and your booty will burn. Interested? Here are [85]seven squat
   variations you NEED to try.

   Lifting Too Little
   If you complete your squats with lighter-weight dumbbells in-hand, you
   might want to consider reaching for something heavier. ‚ÄúWomen tend to
   think that because we want to slim our legs, we should do a lot of reps
   with a low weight,‚Äù says Montenegro. ‚ÄúBut if you don‚Äôt lift more
   weight, you aren‚Äôt going to tone anything.‚Äù Plus, when you lift
   heavier, you burn more calories. Her advice: Try upping the poundage of
   your hand weights so that you can only eek out six reps at a time (with
   proper form, of course!).

   Going to Too-Great Pains to Keep Your Knees Behind Your Toes
   ‚ÄúFor so many years, it has been ingrained in our brains that the knees
   should never go past the toes when squatting,‚Äù says American Council on
   Exercise-certified personal trainer Jessica Matthews, assistant
   professor of exercise science at Miramar College. While letting your
   knees move past your toes increases the stress placed on them by 28
   percent, trying to restrict any forward movement of the knees ups the
   stress placed on your hips by a whopping 1,000 percent, according to a
   2003 University of Memphis study. So instead of dwelling on your knees
   and toes, focus on starting the squat by pushing your hips back before
   lowering your body toward the floor, says Matthews. That will
   automatically reduce how far forward your knees travel, but without
   pre-registering you for a hip replacement.
