   Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) for Diabetes.


   I have been for the last 10 months in China, so reading some stuff
   about Chinese Traditional Medicine and other alternative treatments
   online, all I can say there are a lot of quacks out there. But since I
   am in China, I decided I might as well try it. I went to the Lanzhou
   University Chinese Traditional Medicinal Hospital. Visited a doctor
   specialized in diabetes, so for CTM, this is about as good as it gets.


   For background, I am 52, male, take Metformin 2000 mg, Januvia 100 mg
   and Crestor 10 mg each day, morning glucose between 80-110, BMI 22-23.
   Diagnosed Type 2, May 2012. I have good control, but I eat very low
   carb.


   Chinese Traditional Hospital visit.
    1. No appointments or referrals. You just go to the hospital, sit and
       wait until the specialist sees you.
    2. Swipe ID card is used for all billing, doctor and test records and
       pharmacy orders. An integrated online computer system, they are way
       ahead of the US.
    3. No privacy. Open office door, other doctors, nurses, patients,
       relatives, come in and listen to what is going on.
    4. The hospital smells like the spice area of Whole Foods.

   The doctor asked for medication that I am taking, looked at my glucose
   readings, took my pulse on both hands and checked my tongue. Gave me a
   prescription for 16 different herbs that I should take twice a day for
   7 days. Then come back and he will adjust the herb mixture. And I
   should check my tongue, it is too white and thick, should get redder
   and thinner.


   Total fee, $1 for the ID card, $5 for 7 day medicine supply, doctor $0.
   There are some big advantages to the socialist, or in this case
   communist, health care system.

   But after 1 week, no differences in glucose readings that I can detect.


   The second visit, I got 13 herbs, once daily, mostly different from the
   first 16. Second visit, total cost $8 for 14 day medicine supply.


   Again, no significant difference in glucose reading. I do have the
   impression that, sometimes after drinking it, the next glucose reading
   is 10-20 point lower, but the two readings after that seem higher.  But
   looking at all the glucose readings, nothing significant that I can
   see. Either way, any effect is not consistent, and since I am not
   eating or exercising exactly the same, it is hard to really detect an
   effect.


   In total, clear is, at best, a small and unpredictable effect of
   Chinese Traditional Medicine.  And CTM taste really bad, very bitter.
   So, stick with the regular medication, nothing to gain by adding CTM.


   Cheers, Jean.

   Thank you for your very interesting report.


   I wandered through several giant traditional medical centres in Suzhou
   and Beijing. Apart from the cubicles where the doctors saw patients
   they seemed like giant herbal (and other substances) warehouses. I had
   a cold when I arrived in Beijing but I wasn't as brave as you. I copied
   the characters for pseudoephedrine from a translation web-site and
   found a pharmacy  Smiley Happy


   My main diabetes control technique in China was avoiding excessive
   noodle and rice consumption.


   What part of China are you in?

   Unless one is aware of drug/herb interactions, the contraindiction of
   mixing unknown herbs with current medications, IMO, is unadvisable.

   There are some good things to be said about CTM, such as acupuncture
   and yoga.  In many ways it's also a culture approach as well as a
   medical modality.


   Herbal blends are a big part of the treatment.  One thing that I like
   about Chinese blends is that if one substance causes a side affect
   another is included in the blend to counteract or eliminate it.  This
   is the traditional way.  Also, as in our medicine, one or two visits is
   usually not enough to find the right mixture, it takes time.


   I studied CTM for quite some time, but since this is not my culture and
   most western medicine does not practice it, I decided to stick to what
   was known and practiced in my culture.


   Another thing I really liked about the traditional CTM way was that you
   didn't pay if you got sick, only if you stayed well.  Can you see the
   West doing that?   Smiley Very Happy

   Thanks for the report.  It is always interesting to try something off
   the beaten path and see what happens.  I am not closed-minded enough to
   think that Western medicine has a monopoly on medical knowledge, but I
   am not open-minded enough to think that all the real secrets of
   medicine reside in the centuries-old traditions of other cultures.  I
   like to have real-world reports like yours.


   Chinese medicine offers medical care (of sorts) to the Chinese people
   at low cost, but in my opinion it may be worth about what they pay for
   it.  I do note that whenever the tinpot dictator of some banana
   republic gets seriously ill, he comes to the U.S. for treatment.  I
   guess the exception was Hugo Chavez.  Our medical system is not
   perfect, but neither is anybody else's.

   Alan; Lanzhou, Gansu Province, in the Northwest of China. And yes
   avoiding noodles and rice helps. The worse is steamed white bread, even
   a little spikes me really high.


   Porkee; interactions, yes good point. I test a lot and have not seen
   any spikes. However, also note I did this under supervision of a
   Chinese University doctor trained in CTM, with weekly visits. And herbs
   are plants and here in China I don’t know ½ the ingredients in the food
   that I am eating.


   Lizzylou; sorry I have to disagree with you. Yes yoga is good as it
   relaxes you and lower stress is good for many things. Acupuncture,
   herbs, homeopathy are useless, there is no credible evidence showing
   this. However, believers do get a placebo effect, so if it works for
   believers, great, keep doing it. Here in China, I have noticed that
   CTM, including acupuncture, is only used as a supplement to Western
   medication. So, China is actually using the placebo effect of CTM to
   complement Western medication, never to replace it. So I think all
   those quacks out there trying to make money of things like CTM are
   dishonest and misleading patients looking for some magically.


   George_M: Yes, herbs contain chemicals, so I can see potential ways
   that they might work. But, as I said, no effect for me, however it is
   cheap. And we know that the placebo effect really can help people. So
   using CTM as a supplement to make people who believe it it, feel
   better, makes perfect sense. But since I don’t believe, it is useless
   for me.

   I had forgotten the bread. Not just the steamed bread, but the Chinese
   version of sliced bread which has so much sugar in it that it resembles
   sliced sponge cake. After a couple of tries I ate no more of that.


   I intend going back to China some day. It is vast. I would like to
   visit Tibet, your district and inner Mongolia. We only followed the
   tourist route on our visit last year: Hong kong, Hangzhou, Shanghai,
   Suzhou, Beijing, Xi'An (the nearest I got to Lanzhou), Guilin and
   Yangshuo. If you look in my sig you'll see I am half way through some
   belated trip reports.


   Are you teaching English in Lanzhou?

   And I, in turn have to disagree with you.


   Animals are not affected by the "placebo effect, and yet acupuncture is
   used by many vets now quite sucessfully on them.  And yes, there are
   studies.


   I have also used both yoga and acupuncture very successfully myself,
   but it's too expensive to do on a regular basis.



   Your mind is pretty much closed, so I won't say any more on the
   subject.

   Hi, knops1.  Do you have any experience with the Western medicine side
   of it in China?  How does it compare to the treatment that your
   received in the U.S.?

   Hi Lizzy,


   Ok, let’s agree to disagree. But, I will give you my rationale here.


    1. Plants contain chemicals and some of them clearly have effects,
       think of metformin which is derived from French lilac and there is
       a recent treatment for malaria derived from a plant based on CTM.
       So, I don’t reject CTM outright, but I would like to see some real
       evidence before I add a bunch of chemicals to my body.
    2. The reasoning behind many alternative treatments, like CTM,
       acupuncture, homeopathy, faith healers, etc, conflicts with
       anything we know about chemistry, physics and biology. The same is
       the case for notions like witches, fairies, ghosts, the earth is
       flat, the sun goes around the earth, etc. It mystifies me why
       people believe in this clearly flawed reasoning.
    3. For CTM there are many specialized current journals and I have
       looked at a number of review articles in these journals and
       specific studies looking into diabetes. Up to about 5-15 years ago
       all the research was lousy, current reviews in these Chinese
       journals lament this and ignore most of earlier studies and more
       recent studies are getting much more robust. To summarize it,
       earlier work mostly used a cohort approach, you get 10 people
       (often a range from 5-10), treat all of them, and then examine the
       outcome of the people left after a period. The problem with this
       is, there is no control, nothing to compare it too. Secondly, only
       people enrolled until the end are used in the analysis, even people
       dying and getting much sicker and going into intensive care, were
       excluded. Both these issues make earlier studies pretty much
       useless. For acupuncture pretty much the same. I did see a number
       of recent acupuncture studies that used specific placement of the
       needles according to CTM, versus randomly sticking the same number
       of needles in patients. These studies showed no difference. So
       research is getting better, but much most of what you read in
       books, blogs, etc, is based on the older useless research.
    4. So, reread 1. Yes, I think that we will find new useful chemicals
       based on CTM. But currently there is no logical rational why it
       would work, no clear evidence that it does works, and potentially
       many side effects of unknown chemicals in unknown concentration
       that you consume. So, I would rather wait until the research
       catches up and we know what has a benefit.
    5. So, why did I try it? Well I keep talking to people that say,
       regardless of all the arguments above, I believe in it and it works
       for me, it is personalized medicine and you can’t apply Western
       scientific standards to it, and you are close minded, and not
       willing to consider alternatives.
    6. So, I tried it, and seeing no effect for me, I can clearly say it
       does not work for me. And I tried with a doctor specialized in
       diabetes care at a major CTM University Hospital in China, which is
       as good a CTM treatment as you can get. I would not have done this
       with any of the quacks doing this in the US. I posted this for
       anyone curious about CTM. But in the end, this is my opinion, it is
       a free world out there (at least outside of China), and anyone can
       spend their money anyway they want and do whatever they want.
