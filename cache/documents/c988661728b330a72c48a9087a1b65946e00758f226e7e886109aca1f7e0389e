Higher-Dose, Short-Duration Radiation Better for Early Breast Cancer: Study

   August 6, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [breast_cancer06142.jpg]

   THURSDAY, Aug. 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) — A shorter course of radiation
   therapy is better for women with early stage breast cancer, according
   to a new study.

   Specifically, it found that those who received higher doses of whole
   breast radiation over a shorter period of time had fewer side effects
   and a better quality of life than those who received smaller doses of
   radiation over a longer period of time.

   “Patients who received the shorter course reported less difficulty in
   caring for their families’ needs. This is a major priority for women
   undergoing breast cancer radiation,” study first author Dr. Simona
   Shaitelman, from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
   said in a center news release.

   “Most are busy working mothers, working inside or outside the home, and
   are juggling a number of priorities. It’s paramount that we address
   this need,” explained Shaitelman, who is an assistant professor of
   radiation oncology.

   The study was published Aug. 6 in the journal JAMA Oncology.

   Doctors should use this higher-dose approach — called hypofractionated
   whole breast irradiation — as a starting point when discussing
   treatment options with breast cancer patients, researchers said.

   Radiation therapy for breast cancer in the United States is generally
   given in smaller doses over a longer period of time. This method is
   called conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation.

   Only one-third of patients who should undergo the new, higher-dose
   treatment according to American Society of Radiation Oncology
   guidelines actually receive it, the researchers said.

   Their study included nearly 300 women with early breast cancer (stages
   0-2). The women were all 40 or older. They had undergone breast
   conserving surgery (“lumpectomy”) and were randomly assigned to receive
   either the hypofractionated radiation or conventional radiation.

   During treatment, those in the higher-dose radiation group had fewer
   radiation-related side effects such as breast pain, eczema, skin
   darkening and fatigue than those in the conventional group. Six months
   after treatment, patients in the hypofractionated group had less
   fatigue and were better able to care for their families than those in
   the conventional group.

   Dr. Stephanie Bernik is chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill
   Hospital in New York City. She said, “[This study] suggests that women
   who undergo the accelerated radiation not only benefit from the shorter
   length of time for treatment, but they also suffer less severe side
   effects. Women should discuss with their doctor if they are candidates
   for this type of therapy due to the benefits it offers.”

   Dr. Benjamin Smith is the study’s corresponding author and an associate
   professor of radiation oncology at MD Anderson. “This study fills in a
   missing piece in the literature,” he said in the news release. “No
   longer do I regard the shorter course of treatment as just an option
   for patients, but rather the preferred starting point for discussion
   with patients if they need whole breast radiation.”
