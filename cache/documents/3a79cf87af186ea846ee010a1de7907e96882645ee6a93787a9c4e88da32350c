       traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) I had had a horrible experience
       in the past and was beyond pleased with Acupuncture POINTS. The
       staff was amazing, including all the massage therapy people and the
       owner's wife. If you are new to TCM or just wanting to find a new
       sense of balance from an old form of treatment, Acupuncture POINTS
       is the place to be.
       xiè xie (Thank You)
