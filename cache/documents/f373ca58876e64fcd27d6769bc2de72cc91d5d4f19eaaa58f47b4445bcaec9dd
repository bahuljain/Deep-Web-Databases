   Aethlon Medical Announces First Patient Completes Hemopurifier®
   Clinical Study Protocol PR Newswire Thursday, February 26, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   SAN DIEGO, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Aethlon Medical, Inc.
   ([3]AEMD), the pioneer in developing targeted therapeutic devices to
   address infectious diseases and cancer, today announced that the first
   patient enrolled in the Company's FDA approved feasibility study has
   completed their full Hemopurifier® treatment protocol without any
   device-related adverse events.  The study protocol, which is being
   administered at DaVita Med Center Dialysis in Houston, is enrolling ten
   chronic dialysis patients infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) to
   receive a six treatment protocol of Hemopurifier therapy.  The Aethlon
   Hemopurifier is a first-in-class bio-filtration device that provides
   the broad-spectrum elimination of infectious viruses from the
   circulatory system of infected individuals.
   The feasibility study will contribute safety data to advance the
   Hemopurifier as a candidate therapy to address chronic conditions such
   as HIV and HCV, as well as acute bioterror and pandemic threats that
   are not addressed with proven drug or vaccine therapies.  A detailed
   description of the study, including treatment protocol and patient
   inclusion/exclusion criteria can be accessed online at
   [4]www.clinicaltrials.gov
   "With our feasibility study now under way, we will initiate our
   previously communicated plan to file Humanitarian Use Device (HUD)
   submissions that provide a potential FDA market clearance pathway to
   treat viral indications that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals in the
   U.S. each year," stated Jim Joyce, Chairman and CEO of Aethlon Medical.
   To date, Hemopurifier therapy has been administered outside the United
   States in the treatment of Ebola, HIV and HCV-infected individuals.
   Previously, in vitro studies of bioterror and pandemic threats have
   verified Hemopurifier capture of Ebola hemorrhagic virus, dengue
   hemorrhagic virus, lassa hemorrhagic virus, H5N1 avian influenza (bird
   flu), the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus (r1918), 2009 H1N1
   influenza virus (swine flu), West Nile virus, and monkeypox, which
   serves as a model for human smallpox infection. These studies were
   conducted with leading government and non-government research
   organizations, including The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
   Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC), The National Institute of Virology (NIV), The
   Battelle Biomedical Research Center (BBRC) and The Southwest Foundation
   for Biomedical Research (SFBR).
