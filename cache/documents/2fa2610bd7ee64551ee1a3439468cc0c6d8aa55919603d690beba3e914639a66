      Carbohydrate Counting in Institutions
        __________________________________________________________________

      Standardized calorie-level meal patterns based on exchange lists have
      traditionally been used in hospital settings to plan meals for
      patients. However, it has been recommended that the term "ADA diet" no
      longer be used, as the American Diabetes Association no longer endorses
      any single meal plan or specified percentages of macronutrients.^1 Diet
      orders such as "no concentrated sweets," "no sugar added," and "low
      sugar" are also inappropriate because they do not reflect the diabetes
      nutrition recommendations and unnecessarily restrict sucrose.

      In the position statement "Translation of the Diabetes Nutrition
      Recommendations for Health Care Institutions,"^1 a
      "consistent-carbohydrate" diabetes meal plan is a suggested
      alternative. However, despite these recommendations based on research
      evidence, the actual implementation of carbohydrate-based menu planning
      approaches has been a slow transition that has met much resistance.

      This article summarizes the use of carbohydrate counting in adult
      inpatient, pediatric inpatient, and nursing home settings. Because
      published research is not available on the implementation of
      carbohydrate counting in institutions, an inquiry was posted on the
      e-mail of the Diabetes Care and Education (DCE) practice group of the
      American Dietetic Association to identify registered dietitians who
      have been implementing carbohydrate counting menu systems in their
      institutions. More than 20 dietitians responded. From this group,
      several individuals were interviewed in more detail. Their experiences
      reflect various similarities and differences depending on the type of
      institution and the client base.

      Morton Plant Mease Health Care, Clearwater, Florida
      The author's own institution is the 600-bed Morton Plant Mease Health
      Care hospital in Clearwater, Fla. The population at this hospital is
      mostly elderly, with a small pediatric unit. Diabetes is not the
      primary diagnosis for most patients. After the release of the diabetes
      nutrition guidelines, it was decided that the hospital menus,
      particularly those used for pediatric patients with diabetes, needed to
      be evaluated. The diabetes education and nutrition staff hoped they
      could make the food aspect of diabetes management easier and perhaps
      provide a more positive experience.

      First, the diabetes nutrition educator (author) met with the Food and
      Nutrition dietitians to promote the idea of converting to a
      consistent-carbohydrate menu and to work on menu development. We
      started with the regular menu, but found it was not adequate due to the
      lack of information on the menu regarding food groups. Instead, an
      exchange list menu was used, all designations of exchanges were
      removed, and all the carbohydrate foods were identified. Foods
      containing ~15 g carbohydrate were labeled as one "carb."

      A dessert choice was also added to either lunch or supper each day,
      along with the carb notation. If the dessert contained 30 g
      carbohydrate, it was marked as "2 carbs." Desserts containing three or
      more carbs were not included. At the top of the menu were directions to
      include 35 carbs at each meal, which provided 1,5002,000 calories per
      day. If a patient needed more calories, the number of carbs per meal
      could be increased on an individualized basis.

      Next, we met with the hospital's pediatricians to inform them of the
      new nutrition recommendations and the rationale for the new menu. The
      staff answered their questions and encouraged them to try the new menu.
      They were assured that the traditional exchange list menu would still
      be available. Reactions were mixed from the physicians, but the nurses
      on the pediatric floor were very receptive and anxious to try the new
      menu. They were able to understand the concept and felt comfortable
      using foods from the pantry to replace foods on the tray that patients
      might have refused. Soon, the menu was expanded to all patients with
      diabetes (adult and pediatric) in the hospital.

      Inservice training sessions were provided to floor nurses, and handouts
      were developed for them to use. The teaching materials that the
      hospital's clinical dietitians used were modified to include
      carbohydrate counting, with encouragement for outpatient education
      after discharge.

      Advantages to the consistent-carbohydrate menu system included more
      freedom with and greater variety of choices for patients. The food
      service clerks reported that checking the menu was much faster than
      checking the standard exchange menu. One disadvantage was the time it
      took the clerks to explain the menu to people who had not been taught
      carbohydrate counting. The clerks were encouraged to refer such
      patients to the dietitian for education.

      Baptist Health, Little Rock, Arkansas
      A similar experience in transitioning from traditional to carbohydrate
      counting menus was reported by Lorie Hale, MEd, RD, LD, the clinical
      nutrition manager at Baptist Health in Little Rock, Ark. A
      consistent-carbohydrate diet was implemented in all five of that
      system's hospitals, a project that took about 1 1/2 years to complete.

      It was found that the menu was easier for patients to understand
      because it had only one category for carbohydratenot four, as in the
      traditional menu. The consistent-carbohydrate menu was used with
      calorie ranges from low to very high. Modifications for additional
      nutrients, such as sodium, fat, protein, and potassium, or textures,
      such as soft, were added if needed.

      Staff education was the most difficult part of this project. The
      nutrition department developed inservice training videos and provided
      one for each patient floor. The nutrition department also had to update
      its computer system with new data for the menu. Now, the new menu is
      the only option for patients with diabetes.

      Outcomes were collected at Baptist Health based on how physicians
      placed diet orders. Hale reported about a 45% compliance rate for
      physicians ordering the consistent-carbohydrate menu instead of the
      traditional exchange menu.

      Sunrise Hospital, Las Vegas, Nevada
      Consistent-carbohydrate menus appear to be popular in pediatric
      settings. Holly Brewer, MS, RD, a pediatric dietitian at Sunrise
      Hospital in Las Vegas, Nev., reported that her hospital uses this menu
      only for their pediatric patients. The hospital also adapted the
      exchange lists menu to include portion size and carbohydrate choices
      for each item. The diet order is written as "pediatric diabetic diet,"
      and the carbohydrate gram count and snack information is included in
      the comment section.

      Brewer reported that advantages of the system include less plate waste
      because unwanted vegetables are not forced on patients. The menu does
      not include fat restrictions. Brewer said the menu is easier for
      patients to understand and can be easily translated into their own
      eating habits before they are discharged.

      Few disadvantages were noted in this hospital, although Brewer did
      report a few limitations after discharge. Some patients do not
      completely understand the carbohydrate concept and eat unlimited
      amounts of all foods. Others may increase carbohydrate choices and
      insulin doses accordingly, but experience unwanted weight gain. This is
      especially common for new insulin pump patients. Another problem occurs
      when patients choose only the sweet carbohydrate foods and do not
      include the more nutritious choices.

      Brewer said she now uses a variety of teaching tools, including
      measuring cups, food models, and food labels to explain the concept.
      She finds that food lists, especially for snack foods, are helpful. It
      appears that those taught carbohydrate counting in the hospital when
      newly diagnosed require less teaching time in the outpatient office.
      Patients report greater adherence to the meal plan, and there is an
      easier transition to the insulin pump when carbohydrate counting is
      already in place.

      According to Brewer, the key to implementing the menu into other
      hospitals is educating the staff, including food service personnel who
      check menus, floor nurses who need to understand food substitutions,
      and physicians who write the diet orders.

      Order of St. Francis Medical Center, Peoria, Illinois
      Counting grams of carbohydrate is the focus of the meal plan for
      pediatric patients at Order of St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria,
      Ill. Jerri Haindfield, RD, who works at the hospital's Pediatric
      Diabetes Resource Center, reported their experience in implementing a
      consistent-carbohydrate menu in their pediatric setting. She plans to
      extend it to the adult population. The nursing staff initiated the
      change after patients with diabetes indicated low levels of
      satisfaction regarding meals on patient surveys. The center developed
      its new menu through a multidisciplinary team approach, including Food
      and Nutrition staff, nursing staff, the diabetes resource nurse and
      dietitian, and a physician.

      Interestingly, the menu developed there has grams of carbohydrate for
      each menu item instead of rounding off to carbohydrate servings.
      Haindfield explained that when pediatric patients learn gram counting
      from the beginning, they get the clear message that foods containing
      carbohydrate are important.

      She also believes that rounding off for this group does not provide the
      accuracy needed for best blood glucose management. Many of these
      children go on to intensive management using carbohydrate-to-insulin
      ratios, and the transition is smoother if they are already familiar
      with carbohydrate gram counting. Also, by including grams of
      carbohydrate on the menu, the hospital encourages parents to take the
      initiative to read food labels at home, giving them a head start on
      carbohydrate counting even before the outpatient meeting with the
      dietitian.

      An explanation of the value of carbohydrates in blood glucose
      management is printed on the back of the pediatric diabetes menu.
      Everyone with diabetes receives the same menu, but the newly diagnosed
      children are allowed to eat according to appetite. After the dietitian
      assesses a patient's usual food intake, the number of grams recommended
      is listed on the menu within a 10-g range, i.e., 6070 g per meal. The
      food pyramid is also printed on the back of the menu to reinforce the
      importance of eating a variety of foods from all food groups.

      Another interesting aspect of this institution's menu is the inclusion
      of both sugar-free and regular choices of some items, for example,
      regular and sugar-free jelly and syrup. Patients can choose based on
      their carbohydrate gram goal as well as their food preferences.

      Once again, staff education was the greatest challenge at St. Francis.
      Physicians needed to feel comfortable with the rationale of
      carbohydrate counting, and food service personnel needed to understand
      the import- ance of accurate portion control. Haindfield said the
      hospital's best strategy was seeking input from the multidisciplinary
      team. This increased participation in and acceptance of the new plan
      across disciplines. Inservice training was provided at multiple times
      of day for nurses, and grand rounds were planned for physicians.
      Printing the food pyramid and the explanation of carbohydrate counting
      on the back of the menu was also an effective strategy.

      The Experience at Two Ohio Nursing Homes
      The ADA position statement states that residents of long-term care
      facilities eat better when they are given less-restrictive diets with
      regular foods. It has been shown that short-term substitution of
      regular food for patients with diabetes did not significantly decrease
      blood glucose control. After 16 weeks, alternating between diabetic and
      regular meal plan periods, patients' fasting plasma glucose increased
      an average of 0.6 mmol/L on the regular meal plan, which was
      insiginificant.^2

      Veronica L. Gallo, MS, RD, LD, from Mayfield, Ohio, reported on the use
      of a consistent-carbohydrate menu in two different nursing homes in her
      state. With this menu system, all residents received the same food,
      which increased patient satisfaction. Also, the new menu resulted in a
      reduction in food budget and preparation time.

      According to Gallo, the new menu has remained successful at one of the
      facilities, which has a full-time diet technician. The diet technician
      provides education and addresses the concerns of family members when
      they see menu items they think ought to be restricted. Unfortunately,
      at the other site, which does not have a dedicated nutrition staff
      member, the facility received so many concerned comments from family
      members who see regular food items on the menu that it has
      re-instituted the traditional exchange list menu.

      The availability of someone to answer questions and help educate family
      members is critical to the successful implementation of a
      consistent-carbohydrate menu system.

      Summary
      The variety of experiences reported here demonstrates that every
      institution is different and that it is important to assess patient
      population, food service capabilities, and education opportunities in
      each situation. An interdisciplinary team approach to review and
      determine different meal planning options will help provide the quality
      of care patients deserve at a reasonable and sometimes reduced cost.

      The advantages of consistent-carbohydrate meals in institutions include
      improved food intake by patients, less food waste, and better patient
      understanding of how to best manage diabetes through carbohydrate
      counting after discharge. Staff education is often the most difficult
      part of implementing this system, but the rewards in patient health and
      satisfaction are well worth the effort.
