   Best Answer:  Some drivers will uninstall properly when you install the
   new ones. Some, especially some of the nVidia drivers, will not.
   I suggest always uninstalling the old drivers before installing the new
   ones.
   Remove the old drivers by navigating to device manager --> display
   adapters, double click on your graphics card, select the driver tab,
   and select uninstall for your video card driver.
   Then install the new ones.

       The important thing to know is the chipset makers; ie if you're
       replacing an ATi card with an Nvidia one, no problem, you should be
       able to leave most or all of the software intact. You MUST remove
       drivers & software to avoid problems if you're going from an older
       Nvidia unit to a newer one, for example.
       Personally, I'd remove the old drivers & software anyway as there
       may be other redundant software still taking up space & using
       resources (Many video cards use 'control panel' type software which
       is always running: check icons in your system tray). This may also
       cause error messages as the software looks for it's old hardware on
       startup.
       As above, uninstall it all: 2 minute job.
       Hope this makes it clear.

       It shouldn't really hurt but to be safe you should uninstall the
       old drivers. However if the graphics card you have now is on-board
       then you don't need to worry about it. Just make sure that when you
       upgrade you install the drivers for the new card.

       It might not make a difference.
       You should always uninstall the old drivers, you can do that by
       going into Add/Remove programs, or in Device Manager, but
       technically, if the computer automatically uses the new drivers it
       won't make a difference as long as you don't see a performance
       drop,
       I would recommend uninstalling the drivers though, it takes 5
       minuets and prevents future problems.
