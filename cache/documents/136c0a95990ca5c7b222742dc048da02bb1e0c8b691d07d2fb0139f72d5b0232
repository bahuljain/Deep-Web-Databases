What’s the Best Workout for Weight Loss?

   weight-loss

   Strength training, cardio, [98]Pilates, yoga…which one helps shed the
   pounds the quickest? The short answer–The one that burns up the most
   calories, most efficiently, says Michele Olson, PhD, professor of
   exercise science at Auburn University Montgomery in Montgomery, Ala.

   Cardio is king when it comes to calorie burning, Olson says, and you’ll
   see even better results if your workout has an ‘after burn’ effect.

   [99]Interval-style workouts (alternating between short bursts of high
   intensity effort followed by brief periods of active recovery) are one
   of the best ways to turn on this ‘after burn,’ which can raise your
   metabolic rate for up to four hours after a session, meaning you’ll
   burn more calories even after the workout is over, she explains.

   “Any time you elevate your heart rate into the top end of your target
   zone, the extra fuel (aka calories) you burn up continues in order to
   bring your heart rate and muscle activity back to normal and to
   metabolize the lactic acid you have created.”

   But before you jump into an all-interval, all-the-time [100]cardio
   marathon, there are a few important things to note to maximize your
   exercise time for weight loss: First, too much high intensity cardio
   can burn out your body, leaving you tired, cranky, and too exhausted to
   stick with your routine.

   To avoid this, alternate two or three days per week of higher intensity
   interval workouts with more endurance-focused sessions (exercising at
   an intensity where you can still talk without getting too winded).

   Second, it’s important to build metabolically active [101]lean muscle
   mass to help give your body shape and definition while you continue to
   slim down. For best weight loss results, Olson recommends doing cardio
   (45-60 minutes), five days a week, along with two to three
   non-consecutive days of resistance training.

   Arguably, the best workout for anything (weight loss included) is going
   to be the one that you’ll do! So while calorie burn is important, find
   a way to make fitness fun too. Trade the treadmill for a high energy
   [102]Zumba class or shift from weight machines to a [103]TRX suspension
   trainer to prevent boredom while sticking to your workout schedule.

   And, if you really want to maximize your time and the gym, consider
   workouts that have both a strength and cardio element to them such as
   [104]kettlebell training (a recent study from the [105]American Council
   on Exercise found that total body exercises performed with a kettlebell
   burned a whopping 20.2 calories per minute, or about the equivalent to
   running a 6-minute mile).

   And does that mean you should skip out on the sometime less intense
   workouts like Pilates or yoga if you’re trying to lose weight?
   Definitely not, says Olson. “The body thrives on new and different
   movements such as Pilates and yoga, so incorporate them into your
   weight loss efforts.”

   An [106]active-style yoga class, for example, that keeps your heart
   rate elevated can count as a cardio session, and a Pilates class that
   incorporates added resistance from bands or dumbbells can count as
   strength training.

   Finally, don’t forget that it’s really easy to eat back all the
   calories you burned off at the gym in just minutes, so for true weight
   loss success, couple your workouts with a healthy diet that creates a
   caloric deficit. To stay on track to lose a healthy and realistic 1.5
   pounds per week, Olson suggests eating about [107]500 calories less per
   day and burning off an extra 300 calories through exercise.
