   Meet Kangaroo, a $99 Windows 10 desktop PC as small as a smartphone BGR
   News Monday, October 26, 2015
   Zach Epstein
   Desktop PCs aren’t exactly en vogue right now. In fact, PC sales are
   still in decline across the board and [2]Windows 10 hasn’t been the
   sales boost computer vendors were hoping for despite its overwhelmingly
   positive reception from users. Pundits and analysts have their theories
   on why this negative trend in the PC market has persisted, but perhaps
   the market simply needs something fresh and new to help pique consumer
   interest.
   If it’s fresh and new you’re looking for at a surprisingly affordable
   price point, the brand new [3]Kangaroo PC from [4]InFocus could be just
   what the doctor ordered.

   InFocus bills the Kangaroo as the world’s smallest portable desktop PC.
   The device weighs just 200g and measures 124mm tall, 80.5mm wide and
   12.9mm thick, making the Kangaroo roughly the size of some of the
   larger phablets currently on the market. There are even one or two
   phablets that are far bigger than the Kangaroo. A removable base unit
   adds an HDMI port, two USB ports and a DC power port to the Kangaroo,
   and it’s just 46.9mm tall.
   There is currently no widely used name for this class of device because
   it’s among the first of its kind — a truly portable computer that can
   connect to nearly any screen around you and instantly transform it into
   a desktop PC. Perhaps we can think of it as the ultrabook of desktop
   computing.
   In terms of specs as they might compare to a traditional tower desktop,
   the ultrabook vs. notebook comparison is absolutely apropos. InFocus
   currently offers one version of the Kangaroo and it is powered by an
   Intel Cherrytrail (Atom Z8500) processor clocked at 2.24GHz. This class
   of Intel processor requires no fan, enabling a design that is as
   compact as possible. The Kangaroo also includes 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM and
   32GB of eMMC storage, and it can be expanded by as much as 128GB at a
   time thanks to microSDXC support.
   Dual-band wireless AC ensures a speedy Wi-Fi connection, which is
   important since the device does not have an ethernet port, just as most
   ultra-portable notebook computers no longer include ethernet ports.
   Bluetooth 4.0 cuts back on even more wires by letting the user connect
   a wireless keyboard and mouse rather than hogging the USB ports on the
   included base. Only two cables are necessary with the Kangaroo, an HDMI
   cable to connect to a display and the power cord. The device does pack
   a battery though, and it will last for about four hours of what InFocus
   calls “casual use.”
   As far as performance goes, I’ve been testing the Kangaroo for several
   days and I’m impressed. Windows 10 Home Edition is spry on the device,
   but it’s not quite fit for too heavy a load. It is very well suited for
   browsing the web, working with office files, streaming media and other
   common tasks. And you won’t have to worry about protecting your data on
   the go with the Kangaroo, since it includes a built-in fingerprint
   scanner for protection far more effective than a simple password.
   “Consumers own many different devices including tablets, laptops and
   desktop PCs. Each device is used in different locations for different
   purposes. Kangaroo is the first product to allow you to use the same PC
   for all applications, in any environment,” said InFocus’ marketing boss
   Lawrence Yen. “Unlike stick PCs and other pocket PCs, Kangaroo works
   with all of your existing devices and can be docked at home or tossed
   in your bag to use anywhere, powering and providing Windows 10 access
   on the go.”
   The device truly can be used anywhere, not just in homes and offices
   where a monitor or TV is available. Thanks to the company’s [6]free OS
   Link software for iOS, the Kangaroo can connect to an iPad as well in
   either desktop mode or in tablet mode.
   It really is a novel computer, and it’s remarkably accessible at $99
   including the base. And best of all, perhaps, is the fact that this
   isn’t just some nifty idea about to begin a crowdfunding campaign. The
   Kangaroo is real, and it’s available to purchase beginning today on
   Newegg.com and from Microsoft’s online store. The device will also be
   available to test in person in Microsoft’s physical retail stores
   starting in mid-November.
   A conversation with InFocus ahead of today’s announcements revealed a
   team that is excited to be breathing new life into the desktop PC
   space. InFocus also says that this first Kangaroo model is only the
   beginning, and it has big plans for the future. Higher-end models will
   be made available, but the company has plans to release additional base
   units that can be docked with the Kangaroo to add new functionality.
   User feedback is also going to play a big role in the Kangaroo’s
   future. InFocus will look to users for guidance in developing future
   Kangaroo base attachments and new models. And the company made it quite
   clear that this first model won’t be left behind thanks to the docking
   system it incorporates. New bases can add a wide range of features to
   the Kangaroo in a matter of seconds.
   “We wanted to create something that is incredibly affordable, portable
   and allows you to access Windows 10 and all of your files – from work
   to media – on any device,” Yen said. “You can access any file, any time
   without worrying about access to a network, upload and download times
   or file corruption. With its power, capacity and features, Kangaroo
   will change the definition of mobile computing.”
