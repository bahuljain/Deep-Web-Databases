The Best Diets For Seniors

   [79]U.S. News & World Report January 24, 2015

   The Best Diets For Seniors

   When a panel of health and nutrition experts ranked 35 diets
   for [80]Best Diets 2015, they considered not only weight loss, but also
   whether diets were [81]heart healthy, good for [82]controlling
   diabetes and [83]easy to follow. Now, two panel members discuss which
   U.S. News-ranked diets make the most sense for seniors.

   Fewer Calories/More Protein

   For Amy Campbell, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator,
   the [84]DASH, [85]TLC and [86]Mediterranean diets stood out as smart
   choices for older adults, because they’re good for weight loss as well
   as controlling conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

   As with anyone, overweight and obesity can be issues for seniors,
   Campbell says. “People are living longer, so we’re seeing more of it in
   older adults.” And, she says, “As we get older, our calorie needs go
   down. People don’t need to eat as much as they did when they were 20 or
   30.” Older women generally need anywhere from 1,600 to 2,200 calories
   per day, depending how active they are, Campbell says, while younger
   women need about 1,800 to 2,200 daily. For older men, the range is
   2,000 to 2,800 calories per day, compared with 2,200 to 3,200 calories
   for younger men.

   Frail elderly people face different issues. “One concern for older
   people is getting enough protein,” Campbell says. “We need more as we
   age.” A lack of protein puts people at risk for lower immune function
   and osteoporosis.

   You don’t necessarily have to follow a specific diet, she says, “just a
   well-rounded diet with extra protein.” That means making the most of
   the calories you take in, she says, not just eating a bowl of cereal
   for dinner or making entire meals of toast and tea. “You don’t need
   animal protein in every meal,” says Campbell, who praises lentils,
   beans and chickpeas as great sources of inexpensive protein to round
   out meals.

   Campbell says a very low-fat plan like the [87]Ornish diet might be
   less appropriate and harder for seniors to follow. Similarly, she says,
   the [88]Biggest Loser diet would not be ideal, and the phases could be
   hard to comprehend.

   “For diets in general, it’s best to try and make it easy and fit
   comfortably into a person’s life,” Campbell says. “Ones that promote
   good health but are as easy to follow as possible.”

   Simplicity and Balance

   Michael Davidson, ​director of preventive cardiology at the University
   of Chicago Medical Center and a [89]Best Diets panelist,
   says [90]Weight Watchers and diets with similar structures​ score well
   because of their simplicity. With Weight Watchers, for instance, foods
   are assigned different points, which you add up daily to stay at your
   personal target, which is based on your sex, weight, height and
   age. ”You don’t have to do a lot of thinking about what type of balance
   of foods or menu plans,” Davidson says, which may be somewhat more
   challenging for seniors.

   Long-term compliance was an important factor in ranking diets, Davidson
   says: “What can be a lifelong change instead of just a short-term fix
   for the patient?” Therefore, he says, “it’s really more about variety
   and food choices, as opposed to portion sizes, that are applicable to
   an elderly individual. So it’s the kind of diet I prefer for those
   patients.”

   Davidson sometimes sees iron deficiency in frail older patients. “They
   don’t eat enough red meat; they don’t get enough iron in the diet,” he
   says. Although the [91]paleo diet was lower-ranking among the Best
   Diets, he says “it could be a good diet. It’s had a little bit of a
   hype to it, but the principles are not far off, such as people eating
   more complex carbohydrates and more lean meats.” He points out that
   constipation can be an issue for seniors on low-carb, low-fiber diets.

   Heart Health and Diabetes

   “Of the ranked diets, both DASH and the Mediterranean diet can help
   people with both diabetes prevention and management,” Campbell says.
   They work because they encourage a variety of foods and make people
   aware of the carbs they consume, she adds. Both diets are mentioned in
   the latest [92]nutrition guidelines ​from the American Diabetes
   Association.

   Davidson says people with [93]high cholesterol do better with
   low-saturated fat diets that call for low-fat dairy sources, lean red
   meats and fish. It’s important for seniors with high cholesterol to
   avoid sweet baked goods with trans fats, he says: “We now recognize
   that trans fats as especially bad among all the fats we can consume.”

   Doable Diets

   “We’re all creatures of habit,” Campbell says. So, she says, imagine
   you’re 75 years old and have to change your habits and incorporate new
   foods like tofu. Although most diets offer plenty of online and printed
   resources, they can be overwhelming. “It’s hard sometimes to pick up a
   book and say, ‘what should I be eating,’” she says. For older adults,
   it can help to [94]work with dietitians.

   Davidson says the Weight Watchers point system works well, because it
   makes eating balanced meals easy. Others that provide prepared meals
   throughout the day, such as [95]Jenny Craig and [96]Nutrisystem, “keep
   caloric content low but steady throughout the day,” he says. “And those
   work for the elderly quite well.”

   Cost can be a problem. Jenny Craig foods cost an average $15 to $23
   each day, plus enrollment and consultation costs. Weight Watchers’
   nonfood expenses can reach nearly $70 per month, plus the cost
   of either Weight Watchers-brand or outside foods. “You can try and
   mimic the Weight Watchers diet and find prepared meals that work for
   patients [when expense] is an issue for the elderly,” Davidson says.
   His office provides a seven-day meal plan with menus and counseling for
   patients.

   Fruits and Veggies

   U.S. News also ranks [97]Best Plant-Based Diets, with the Mediterranean
   and [98]Flexitarian diets in the top spots. Seniors often fall short
   when it comes to fruits and vegetables, Campbell says.

   It’s possible to eat healthy produce on a limited budget. “Frozen
   fruits and vegetables can be cheaper and sometimes even healthier than
   fresh, depending where they’re shipped from,” Campbell says. Canned
   produce can be OK, she says, if there’s no added salt.

   Fluid Balance

   Sense of thirst can decline with age, so drinking enough water is
   important for preventing dehydration. Fluids such as soda or fruit
   juice add a lot of calories, Campbell notes, and it’s not good for
   people with diabetes to drink juice all day. Instead, she suggests
   flavored water or water with a slice of lemon. She has good news for
   coffee and tea lovers: Caffeine is not as dehydrating as once thought.

   Davidson says with the [99]Atkins diet, especially in the induction
   phase, patients on diabetes medications can experience low blood sugar
   and diuresis (they may urinate more). While he generally supports very
   carb-restrictive diets, he says moderate programs are better for many
   seniors.
