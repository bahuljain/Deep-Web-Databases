HIV

Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is a virus that attacks the immune
system. Without treatment, HIV can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome). People with AIDS have a hard time fighting off infections, which
can be potentially life-threatening. There's no cure for HIV, but it can take
years10 or morefor AIDS to develop, even without treatment. And with
treatment (there are many types of drugs that fight HIV), people with HIV can
remain symptom-free for much longer.
