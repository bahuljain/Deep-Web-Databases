Woman May Have Contracted HIV from Manicure: Should You Be Worried?

   Woman May Have Contracted HIV from Manicure: Should You Be Worried?

   Could a single trip to the nail salon change your life
   forever? (Kenneth Willardt/Trunk Archive)

   For most women, the worst thing that’s happened at a nail salon is that
   they’ve chosen a polish color they end up regretting — or maybe they’ve
   had their nails clipped a little too close. But for one 22-year-old
   woman in Brazil a manicure turned potentially deadly: Getting her nails
   done may have given her HIV.

   The young woman, whose case is detailed in the journal [80]AIDS
   Research and Human Retroviruses, was recently diagnosed with advanced
   HIV yet failed to meet any of the standard conditions for transmission
   — she’d never had sex, a blood transfusion or surgery, or gotten a
   piercing or tattoo.

   Doctors were befuddled as to how she had contracted the virus.

   After confirming her claims, her doctors dug deeper, searching for any
   incident that could have infected her. The only possibility: The
   patient recalled sharing manicure instruments 10 years prior with her
   cousin, a manicurist who was later diagnosed with HIV. Detailed
   analyses revealed that the two women were, in fact, infected with
   highly similar strains of the virus, leading the researchers to
   conclude that manicure instruments are potential routes of HIV
   transmission.

   Although most of us aren’t sharing cuticle scissors with an
   HIV-infected friend, the majority of women — and a number of men — have
   probably gotten a manicure at a nail salon, where instruments are
   regularly reused. Disinfection standards vary from state to state,
   although most include these steps, according to the U.S.
   [81]Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA): Wash the
   instruments in soap and water, soak them in a disinfectant for 10 to 30
   minutes, rinse the tools in clean water and dry them with a clean
   cloth, then store them in a clean, covered area.

   The problem is, there are more than 48,000 nail salons in the United
   States, according to industry publication [83]Nails Magazine, and we
   can’t possibly know what’s happening in the back room of every salon,
   although state inspections are supposed to catch any violations. But
   that may not be happening as often as it should be: New York, for
   example, has 27 inspectors. This small group of officials is
   responsible for reviewing all of the state’s salons, including the vast
   number in New York City alone, according to a [84]recent report. Over a
   four-year period, 19 percent of the state’s salons were cited for
   sanitary violations.

   In addition, “Salons come under the department of cosmetology, not the
   department of health. So they don’t have the same rigidity for
   inspection,” said Dr. David A. Johnson, a professor of medicine at
   Eastern Virginia Medical School.

   Nationwide, the problem may be even greater than the New York numbers
   suggest. Dr. Robert Spalding, a podiatrist and author of [85]Death by
   Pedicure: The Dirty Secrets of Nail Salons, estimates that 75 percent
   of U.S. nail salons don’t follow state guidelines for disinfection of
   instruments. And even if they do comply, the requirements may not be
   stringent enough. “The states don’t require nail salons to sterilize
   their instruments,” Spalding told Yahoo Health. “They only require them
   to do basic disinfection.”

   Those jars of blue liquid you see on salon counters contain the
   disinfecting agent — and it’s only effective when used correctly 100
   percent of the time. “If they don’t change the [disinfecting agent] on
   a daily basis, if they don’t soak the instrument for 10 minutes, and if
   they don’t hand-clean it before they soak it, none of that stuff
   works,” he said.

   Does failure to properly disinfect actually translate to an increased
   risk of infection? Maybe. It doesn’t take much to damage the delicate
   skin around your nails, creating what Spalding calls “salon
   microtraumas,” which act as points of entry for viruses or bacteria.
   “You can break the skin and inoculate somebody without drawing blood,”
   he said, which is why nail techs aren’t supposed to perform
   “aggressive” treatments, like digging out ingrown toenails.

   “If you’ve ever used a nail file, and it starts to burn, that’s all it
   takes to break the skin,” Spalding said. Similarly, if your nail tech
   damages the hyponychium — the seal that holds the nail to the nail bed
   — while cleaning underneath your nails, you may not bleed, but the
   barrier has still been broken, potentially allowing infectious agents
   lingering on contaminated instruments to enter, he said.

   "The manicurist uses a cuticle scissor or buffer. They get a little bit
   of microscopic blood on it that stays on the device, and then it maybe
   just gets put in a cleaning solution," Johnson told Yahoo Health. "That
   doesn’t really get the particle off — the viral or bacterial infectious
   agent is still there. Then the tool gets reused, and somebody with
   disruption of the membrane has contact with the [infectious agent].”

   There have been verified cases of hepatitis infection in nail salons,
   prompting the [86]American College of Gastroenterology to call for
   research in this area. (In fact, one of Johnson’s family members
   contracted hepatitis C after getting a manicure.) But the HIV case in
   Brazil seems to be the first of its kind. OSHA, however, has long
   cautioned nail techs that exposure to HIV is a risk to be aware of.

   So could HIV transmission happen in nail salons stateside? “It’s
   possible. Any sharp instrument could theoretically carry this risk,”
   said Dr. Ronald Hershow, an infectious disease expert at the University
   of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, who has studied HIV in
   women. In fact, according to the study authors of the infected woman’s
   case analysis, tattooing, acupuncture, and piercings are recognized as
   potential modes of transmission.

   For manicures, “they use metal instruments and files, and there might
   be blood or blood-derived body fluids, like the oozy material that
   comes out of a skin lesion. If you’re filing a cuticle and get a little
   blood on the file, then use it on a person, there would be some risk,
   yes,” Hershow told Yahoo Health.

   However, that risk is probably “negligible,” he said, based on data
   about HIV transmission through needles and scalpels in health-care
   settings. If a nurse accidentally sticks herself with a needle used to
   draw blood from an HIV-infected patient, “the risk [of transmission] is
   not that high — one in 300,” Hershow said. “Scalpel injuries are
   thought to have an even lower risk.” In other words, even if your nail
   tech is using dirty tools, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll walk out
   with an infection, however disgusting the thought is.

   Even so, it’s smart to protect yourself at the nail salon, since you
   don’t know who’s been there before you, how thoroughly the techs
   disinfect their tools, or whether you’ve endured microtraumas to your
   skin. Before booking an appointment, Spalding suggests asking your
   salon these questions:

   Do you follow state standards for using a liquid disinfectant or an
   autoclave to sterilize instruments? Only one state, Texas, requires
   salons to sanitize their instruments through with autoclaves, a
   technique that uses pressurized steam (which is also the way hospitals
   sanitize equipment used on Ebola patients). If you can find a salon
   that has invested in a true autoclave — not a rice cooker or a
   baby-bottle steamer stand-in, said Spalding — you’re in luck:
   “Autoclaving works every time,” he said, whereas blue-liquid
   disinfection is more subject to human error.

   That said, if your salon uses “high-level disinfection,” you should
   still be safe. “This means it meets the criteria to kill things like
   tuberculosis, HIV, or hepatitis,” said Johnson. “It requires a two-step
   process: One is mechanical cleaning, like a brush, followed by a
   high-level disinfectant.”

   Do you use razorblades to cut calluses? Safe salons don’t offer
   services like this.

   Do you wear gloves? OSHA advises that salon techs wear gloves when
   doing manis or pedis — and then toss them immediately after use.

   Have your nail techs received advanced training? Nearly half of salon
   techs have participated in online continuing education in the last
   year, according to a survey by [88]Nails Magazine. Fifty-nine percent
   have taken a class at a trade show. These are the techs you want. The
   best bet: Ask if your tech has taken one of Spalding’s courses at
   [89]MediNail.com, the only program in the country that teach techs
   about microtraumas and related health issues.

   If you’re really concerned, Johnson suggests bringing your own manicure
   equipment with you (although this isn’t allowed in all states, noted
   Spalding). Then after your appointment, do your part: Fill out a safety
   survey about your salon at [90]SafeSalonRating.com (Or download the
   app.) to help Spalding create a database of health-conscious salons.
