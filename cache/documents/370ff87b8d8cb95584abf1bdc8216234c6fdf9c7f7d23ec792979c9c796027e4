   If you haven’t started following the 2014 World Cup yet, the time is
   now: Tonight marks the first match for the U.S. men’s national soccer
   team. They face rival Ghana, a powerhouse squad that’s sent the
   Americans home during the previous two World Cups.

   No matter the outcome, there’s no denying that soccer players are some
   of the fittest athletes of any sport. We dare you to turn on the game
   and NOT be motivated by their athleticism. Even if you [98]don’t know
   much about the World Cup, these numbers should get your head spinning:

   7
   Average distance, in miles, each player can run per game. Though they
   typically stay within their assigned zones of the field and get to take
   short rests. Mid-fielders (who play both offense and defense), see the
   most action, running up to 9.5 miles per game, according to SportVU.
   Compared to other sports, [99]soccer players outrun most other
   athletes, besting basketball and tennis players.

   8
   Maximum distance, in miles, a referee could run during a game.
   [100]Runner’s World recently reported that refs run 6 to 8 miles per
   game. A single referee tracks the ball over the entire field and relies
   on the help of up to two [101]assistant refs to help him enforce the
   rules if they happen outside his view.

   3
   Number of daily workouts the U.S. team had in the four weeks leading up
   to the World Cup. [102]Training camp started May 14th at Stanford
   University and included 30-minute runs before breakfast, a morning
   practice and an afternoon practice. (And some ping pong before bed.)

   90
   [103]Length of a game in minutes, plus any “stoppage” time. That’s two
   45-minute halves (with a 15-minute halftime) and, at the end of the
   second half, extra time gets added to the clock to make up for when
   play was halted as the result of injuries, fouls, and substitutions
   (the clock keeps running throughout the match). Phew!

   5:20
   Average running pace per mile [104]potential World Cup referees must
   maintain during the second part of the [105]fitness test from the
   Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). They have to
   complete 10 laps on a track (or 2.5 miles) in 21:30, with a quarter of
   that distance spent walking. Here’s the breakdown: Run 150 meters in 30
   seconds (that’s 5:20 per mile), then walk 50 meters in 35 seconds. They
   repeat that sequence 20 times. That’s AFTER the sprint test, where they
   must finish six 40-meter sprints under 6 seconds each, with only 90
   seconds rest in between. So yeah, the refs are in ridiculous shape,
   too.

   69,3000
   Size, in square feet, of the [106]minimum regulation soccer pitch (for
   you soccer newbies, that’s the field). That’s 1.59 acres of surface
   area to cover. Per FIFA rulings, the fields for international matches
   must be between 110 yards long by 70 yards wide and 120 yards long by
   80 yards wide.

   24
   Width, in feet, between [107]goalposts—and the goal is 8 feet high. No
   wonder U.S. goalie [108]Tim Howard trains a minimum of three hours a
   day in order to stop shots in their tracks.
