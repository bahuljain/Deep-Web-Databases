What 5 Amazing Athletes Eat for Breakfast

   What does the breakfast of champions really look like? We asked five
   incredible athletes (from an ultrarunner to a yogi) how they fuel up in
   the morning to stay so fit. Then our expert—Kim Larson, RDN, a sports
   dietitian at [99]Total Health in Seattle, and a spokesperson for the
   American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics—weighed in to explain how
   each tasty [100]breakfast nourishes an active body.

    Yogi Rachel Brathen: Upside-down granola in a jar

   Known to her fans simply as “[101]Yoga Girl,” Brathen is a star on
   Instagram, where she shares stunning photos of herself doing crazy-hard
   poses (think headstand on a [102]paddleboard floating in tropical blue
   water) with her 1.4 million followers. The yoga instructor, who lives
   in Aruba, published a memoir this spring that became a New York Times
   bestseller (Yoga Girl, $20, [103]amazon.com). She hopes her work
   inspires people to live a healthier lifestyle. Her fave
   breakfast—homemade granola, yogurt, and berries (or as she calls it,
   “heaven in a jar”)—is a yummy way to start.

   Nutrition perks: Brathen’s parfait is literally layered with energizing
   ingredients. “Fruit provides fiber and readily available glucose to the
   muscles, along with antioxidants to reduce inflammation,” Larsen points
   out, “while almonds contribute protein, more fiber, and healthy fats.”
   Yogurt delivers extra protein, and vitamins and minerals that are key
   for nerve contractions and bone and muscle health.

   Kitchen prep: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix 2
   tbsp. coconut oil and 1 tbsp. maple syrup and set aside. In a large
   bowl, combine 1 cup oats, ½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut, ½ cup
   chopped hazelnuts, ½ cup slivered almonds, ½ cup chopped dried figs, ½
   cup chopped dried apricots, ½ tsp. chia seeds, a pinch of Himalayan
   salt, and a pinch of cinnamon. Add the coconut/maple syrup blend. Mix
   well—use your hands if you like! Spread on a baking sheet and bake
   until golden, stirring occasionally. Let cool. To serve, put 3/4 cup
   granola at the bottom of a half-pint mason jar, and fill with yogurt
   and mixed fresh berries. Drizzle honey on top.

   Ultrarunner Jenn Shelton: Oatmeal mole

   “I used to not eat before running,” says Shelton, a
   [105]Patagonia-sponsored athlete (and rock star of ultramarathoning).
   “Over the years, as I started adding more distance to my runs, that had
   to change.” But she never in a million years expected oatmeal to be her
   morning meal of choice: “I’d camped way too much in my life to ever eat
   [the stuff] again,” she jokes. But then Shelton discovered savory
   oatmeal dishes, and after some tinkering, came up with this recipe that
   calls for bacon, avocado, eggs, broth, and mole sauce (the ready-to-eat
   kind).

   Nutrition perks: This meal is designed for long-lasting energy, says
   Larson. “It contains a good dose of calories and healthy fat from the
   bacon and avocado, along with oats for consistent performance.” The
   fiber-rich whole grains help keep your blood sugar balanced. Meanwhile
   eggs provide muscle-sustaining protein, and the salt in the broth and
   bacon helps replace electrolytes the body loses through sweat, she
   says.

   Kitchen prep: Bring chicken broth to a boil, stir in steel-cut oats,
   then reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. (One part oats to two
   parts broth yields thicker oatmeal; for a creamier consistency,
   add more broth.) Heat mole in a small saucepan. (Shelton likes the
   [106]roasted mole sauce from Native Kjalii Foods). Then carefully poach
   eggs in the mole, with the lid on the pan. Cook bacon in a saucepan
   over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and
   chop. In the skillet with the bacon dripping, sauté diced tomato and
   onion until they soften and brown slightly. Stir bacon, tomato, and
   onion into the oatmeal. Sprinkle on queso fresco. Spoon your oatmeal
   into a bowl, add eggs, drizzle with mole, and top with sliced avocado
   and chopped cilantro. Store the leftover mole for another meal.

   Surfer Tatiana Weston-Webb: Kale and onion scramble

   Raised on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, Weston-Webb has been addicted
   to waves since she was a little kid. This year at age 19, the [108]Body
   Glove surfer made it to the big stage as the only female rookie on the
   World Championship Tour. She credits her mom, a pro bodyboarder, for
   her competitive drive, which has helped her shoot up the rankings from
   no. 16 to no. 7. She may be elite surfing’s newest threat, but
   Weston-Webb starts her day like a lot of us do—with a veggie scramble
   and toast.

   Nutrition perks: In addition to a high protein-to-carb ratio (which
   helps keep you full longer), this breakfast boasts the super green
   [109]kale and its bounty of antioxidants (including vitamins A and C).
   “The bread supplies the carbohydrates to keep the brain sharp and
   focused and the muscle stores topped off,” Larson adds.

   Kitchen prep: Crack 4 eggs in a bowl and blend with salt and pepper.
   Dice half an onion and sauté in a large skillet over medium heat in 1
   tsp. of coconut oil until translucent. Add about 1 cup of kale and
   sauté until wilted. Pour the eggs into the skillet and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until just set. Serve on toasted gluten-free bread with
   hot sauce to taste

   Skier Lindsey Vonn: Steel cut oatmeal and Greek yogurt

   After two devastating crashes that put her on the sidelines at the
   Sochi Olympics, Vonn is back at the top of her sport: In January she
   won her 63^rd World Cup race and officially became the best female
   skier in history. Vonn—who has a well-earned rep for her grit and
   single-minded drive—fuels up with two classic healthy staples:
   [111]oatmeal and [112]Greek yogurt. “I need all that protein in the
   morning to get me through the day!”

   Nutrition perks: “Steel-cut oats are the most unprocessed of all the
   oats,” says Larson. “They digest slowly—keeping hunger at baby and
   supplying steady energy.” A side of Greek yogurt adds protein (17 grams
   per 6 oz. container), as well as a host of other nutrients: calcium,
   vitamin D, phosphorous, magnesium, [113]vitamin B12, and zinc. Plus,
   Larson says, the sodium and [114]potassium in dairy help balance
   electrolytes lost as you train.

   Kitchen prep: To cook the oatmeal, bring 3 to 4 cups of water to a
   boil. Pour in 1 cup steel-cut oats and stir. When the water returns to
   a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
   occasionally, until the oats are tender. Vonn sweetens her bowl with a
   bit of agave nectar. You may also want to add a touch of sweet to the
   Greek yogurt with agave, honey, or fruit.

   Cyclist Mary Zider: Blueberry oat and polenta pancakes

   After a Division 1 soccer career at Boston College, Zider took
   up cycling for fun, and discovered a new sport to love. Today she rides
   for the Colavita/Bianchi Women’s Pro team, and also serves as its
   director sportif, coaching her teammates through events around the
   country. One of the perks of being sponsored by an Italian food
   company? These [116]Blueberry oat and polenta pancakes prepared by the
   team chef on race days.

   Nutrition perks: Cycling requires a lot of carbs and calories. “This
   breakfast scores high marks for both,” says Larson. And it’s got
   protein (in the eggs and milk), antioxidants (in the almonds and
   berries), and fiber and B vitamins (in the whole wheat flour and
   polenta). “B vitamins assist in the release of energy from foods,” she
   explains.

   Kitchen prep: To make six servings, whisk together 1 3/4 cup milk, 2
   large eggs, 2 tbsp. molasses and 1 tbsp. vanilla in a medium bowl. In a
   separate bowl, mix ½ cup rolled oats, 1 cup whole wheat flour, ¾ cup
   Colavita Instant Polenta ($17, [117]amazon.com), ½ cup shredded
   unsweetened coconut, 1 tsp. cinnamon, ½ tsp. nutmeg, zest from half a
   lemon, 4 tbsp. chia seeds, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda,
   and 1 tsp. salt. Combine the dry and wet ingredients. Stir in 1 cup
   blueberries. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with
   extra-virgin olive oil. Ladle the batter onto the griddle in ¼ cup
   sized scoops and cook or about 1 1/2  to 2 minutes on each side,
   flipping when bubbles start to appear in the middle of the pancake.
   Enjoy with [118]homemade blueberry syrup.
