Bird Flu Spreads Across China, Posing Threat to People: Report

   March 11, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [bird_flu2.jpg]

   By Dennis Thompson
   HealthDay Reporter

   WEDNESDAY, March 11, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Avian flu, commonly called
   “bird flu,” is gaining strength in China and has the potential to
   emerge as a life-threatening virus for humans across the globe, a new
   report suggests.

   In the year since avian flu first surfaced in China, it has expanded
   throughout that country and become a persistent infection in chickens
   there, the new report states.

   The virus also has begun to mutate in chickens, raising concerns that
   it could gain the ability to more easily infect humans and spread
   beyond China, the study authors warned.

   “Therefore, H7N9 viruses should be considered as a major candidate to
   emerge as a pandemic strain in humans,” Yi Guan, from the University of
   Hong Kong, and colleagues concluded in the March 11 issue of the
   journal Nature.

   Avian flu, also known as H7N9 influenza, first appeared in eastern
   China in March 2013 when the virus spread to humans from infected
   poultry, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention.

   A second wave of the H7N9 outbreak that began in late 2013 has resulted
   in at least 318 human infections and more than 100 deaths — more than
   twice that of the first wave, the study authors said.

   To better understand this second wave and predict its path, researchers
   monitored the evolution and spread of H7N9 over 15 cities across five
   provinces in China.

   The researchers identified a large number of new genetic variants that
   have become established in chickens, and tracked the march of those
   viral mutations across the country as chickens were sold and
   transported.

   “With the recent reports of H7N9 infections in Xinjiang in the far
   northwest of China, it is probable that the H7N9 virus is now present
   across most of China,” the study authors wrote. “As this virus does not
   cause obvious symptoms in chickens and only limited surveillance has
   been conducted, the prevalence of this virus is likely to be higher
   than we document here,” they added.

   U.S. infectious disease experts said the new report out of China raises
   serious concerns.

   “Yes, we should be worried,” said Dr. Trish Perl, an infectious disease
   expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. “The story they tell is
   extremely compelling. They show this avian flu almost marching through
   different regions in China.”

   Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an infectious diseases specialist at North Shore
   University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., added that “influenza viruses
   recombine, evolve and develop new strains continuously. This virus
   appears widespread in bird populations. And we wonder if this flu could
   be ‘the big one,’ repeating the great flu outbreak of 1918, which
   caused 100 million deaths worldwide.”

   The study authors propose measures that can be taken to slow or halt
   the spread of the avian flu. These include permanently closing all live
   poultry markets, halting the transportation of poultry between regions
   during a disease outbreak, and shutting down large poultry slaughtering
   plants.

   According to Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician with Lenox Hill
   Hospital in New York City, “Unless swift measures to control the spread
   of H7N9 are put into place, there could be a major spread of the virus
   throughout China and the rest of Asia.”

   And, Glatter added, “with the ease of air travel, it is possible that
   the virus could even make it to Europe and the United States.”

   Ellen Silbergeld is a professor of environmental health sciences at the
   Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. She said
   that officials in China also need to improve their surveillance of H7N9
   in chickens at large poultry houses.

   Silbergeld believes that big poultry houses likely pose an even greater
   threat than live poultry markets for the spread of avian flu. She
   suggested that the ventilation systems in the big facilities allow for
   easy spread of the virus between chickens.

   “A lot of the programs are still designed to give a free ride to the
   large-scale chicken industry, because it’s ‘confined,'” which allegedly
   prevents chickens from catching viruses from other passing birds,
   Silbergeld said.

   “But all of the houses are very heavily ventilated, and the ventilation
   system is the Achilles’ heel,” she continued. “The modern industrial
   poultry production is actually worse, because it’s not really contained
   and it’s got so many more organisms, providing a playground for viral
   evolution.”

   However, Perl pointed out that humans have one new advantage — improved
   genetic sequencing technology that has revolutionized epidemiology and
   made studies like this possible.

   “The technology at use in this setting is going to be extremely
   powerful in helping us understand emerging infectious diseases,” Perl
   said. “Now we need to develop surveillance systems that
   cross-communicate with humans as well as animals and are global. We
   need to leverage these techniques so we can put into place appropriate
   prevention measures.”
