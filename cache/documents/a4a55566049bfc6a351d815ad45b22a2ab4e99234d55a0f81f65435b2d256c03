       served Ector County and the surrounding 17 counties of the Permian
       Basin for over 60 years. We've come a long way since we opened our
       doors in 1949, growing from a small county hospital into a
       prosperous 402-bed regional medical center serving over 100,000
       patients annually. While we've seen many changes over the years,
       some things have remained unchanged. We are still the only
       full-service hospital in the region, and we still strive to deliver
       the best care possible for the people of the Permian Basin. Through
       the years, this once small 85 bed community hospital has grown to
       become a 402 bed regional medical center; a teaching hospital; and
       now a health care system including satellite outpatient services
       and integrated physician services. However, one thing remains a
       constant - the provision of high quality care. When you come to
       Medical Center Health System, whether as a patient or a visitor,
       our staff of over 1,750 employees will provide you friendly, safe,
       and caring services in an environment that is supported by our
       vision to be recognized as the premier health system in the Permian
       Basin. Our team of caregivers is comprised of people you know -
       your friends, family, and neighbors. They are people who care;
       people you can trust to meet your healthcare needs.
