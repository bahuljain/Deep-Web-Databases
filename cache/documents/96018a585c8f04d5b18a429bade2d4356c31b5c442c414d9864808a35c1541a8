Wife-Carrying Championship: The Craziest Race You’ve Ever Seen

   By now, we’ve all heard about obstacle races and [99]mud runs, but how
   about an event where you hurdle logs and trudge through muddy water
   pits—with a person on your back? That’s exactly what happened during
   Saturday’s 15th annual [100]North American Wife Carrying Championship
   at the Sunday River Resort in Newry, Maine.

   Fifty man-and-woman pairs (though not necessarily couples) competed in
   25 qualifying heats to see who could run the regulation 287-yard course
   fastest. The winning team gets the woman’s weight in beer and five
   times her numerical weight in cash.

   The sport began in Finland in the 1990s and is based on a 19th century
   Finnish legend [102]Ronkainen the Robber who allegedly auditioned
   members of his gang by making them run through a difficult course
   carrying either a heavy sack, or a woman stolen from a nearby village.

   Now, it’s hard enough to hurdle and trudge with just your own body
   weight, so securing the female passenger without hindering the runner’s
   movement is essential. (No piggybacks here.) Most teams use the
   “Estonian carry,” where the woman hangs upside down on the man’s back
   with her arms around his waist and her feet wrapped around his neck.

   This year’s champions, with a time of 1:04.10, were friends Jesse Wall
   and Christina Arsenault. They won 10 cases of beer—measured on an epic
   wooden see-saw “scale” using one of the hurdles—and $482.50.

   Wall and Arsenault have been competing together since 2010 and have
   finished in the top 3 each year. They also advanced to the
   [103]20^th Wife Carrying World Championships in Sonkajärvi, Finland, in
   July.

   Here are 7 more amazing photos from the event:
