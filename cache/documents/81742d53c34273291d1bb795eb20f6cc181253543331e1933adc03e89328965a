   I've kept these on my computer for awhile now.  Since the old boards
   when my daughter was first Dx'd.  They've helped me to keep my cool in
   times of stress and given me encouragment at the times I've needed
   them.  So, again, I'm going to post them for the newest members of the
   forums here.   And no, these are not mine, nor do I claim them.  They
   were found and posted by other parents back about the time I joined
   this forum and I just want to pass them on to the new parents here.  I
   hope they help you as they have me, if nothing else, maybe give you a
   smile for today.




How God Selects The Mother Of A Child With Diabetes

   By: Erma Bombeck

   Most women become mothers by accident, some by choice, a few by social
   pressures and a couple by habit. Did you ever wonder how mothers of
   children with Diabetes are chosen? Somehow I visualize God hovering
   over Earth selecting his instruments for propagation with great care
   and deliberation. As he observes, he instructs his angels to make notes
   in a giant ledger.


   "Armstrong, Beth, son. Patron Saint Matthew."
   "Forrest, Marjorie, daughter. Patron Saint Cecilia."
   "Rutledge, Carrie, twins. Patron Saint Gerard. He's used to profanity."


   Finally, he passes a name to an angel and smiles, "Give her a child
   with Diabetes." The angel is curious. "Why this one, God? She's so
   happy."
   "Exactly", smiles God. "Could I give a child with Diabetes to a mother
   who does not know laughter? That would be cruel."


   "But has she the patience?" asks the angel.
   "I don't want her to have too much patience, or she will drown in a sea
   of self-pity and despair. Once the shock and resentment wear off,
   she'll handle it. I watched her today. She has that feeling of self and
   independence that is so rare and so necessary in a mother. You see, the
   child I am going to give her has her own world. She has to make it live
   in her world and that's not going to be easy."


   "But ,Lord, I don't think she even believes in you."
   God smiles. "No matter. I can fix that. This one is perfect. She has
   just enough selfishness."


   The angel gasps. "Selfishness? Is that a virtue?"
   God nods. "If she cannot separate herself from the child occasionally,
   she will never survive. Yes, this is a woman whom I will bless with
   less than perfect."

   "She does not realize it yet, but she is to be envied. I will permit
   her to see clearly the things I see....ignorance, cruelty,
   prejudice...and allow her to rise above them. She will never be alone.
   I will be at her side every minute of every day of her life because she
   is doing my work as surely as if she is here by my side."


   "And what about her Patron Saint?" asks the angel, his pen poised in
   mid air. God smiles. "A mirror will suffice."



   And then there is this one.....


   c1987 by Emily Perl Kingsley. All rights reserved

   I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a
   disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique
   experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like
   this......


   When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous
   vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your
   wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in
   Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very
   exciting.

   After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack
   your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The
   stewardess comes in and says, "Welcome to Holland."


   "Holland?!?" you say. "What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for
   Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going
   to Italy."

   But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland
   and there you must stay.

   The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible,
   disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's
   just a different place.


   So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole
   new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would
   never have met.

   It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy
   than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your
   breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has
   windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.


   But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and
   they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And
   for the rest of your life, you will say "Yes, that's where I was
   supposed to go. That's what I had planned."


   And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because
   the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.

   But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to
   Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely
   things ... about Holland.

   Not to get in the way of your request, but if you hover over the word
   Options in the upper right corner of Dragonstar's post, one of the
   options that shows up is Print.  Click on Print and you will see a
   cleaned up version of Dragonstar's post.  Then you can just use the
   Print feature from the menu at the top of the page or press Ctrl + p to

   Thank you soooo much for the posts. I'm sitting here at baseball
   practice with my sons as I read, trying not to look like a dork because
   I'm crying while I stare at my iPhone. Oh, these are keepers. I had an
   epiphany one day when I was crying to God, "why me? Why us?". My answer
   was a simple, "because I know I can trust you with this.". So I now
   proclaim IT IS A PRIVLEGE to care for a child with diabetes!!!

   I had the same epiphany. I look at my son and admire his will power and
   stregth in dealing with his diabetes. He is the bravest and wisest ten
   year old boy I know because of this. He is compationate toward others
   less fortunate and with worse struggles. I truly believe he chose this
   as his life path because he took responsibility and accepted diabetes
   better than I did. Then I realized...I've also been preparing myself
   for this all my life in ways only a parent of diabetes would know ( too
   many ways to mention).

   How old was your son when he was diagnosed?    I'm so impressed he is
   so responsible with his care!  I am having a tough time motivating my
   daughter to take charge.  She just has this feeling of doom, that she
   has no hope for a future.   I wish I could get it through to her that
   she can control this and live a normal life, but she won't get serious
   about her control.    I, of course, know what she needs to do, but she
   excludes me a lot and isn't honest about her readings, very
   discouraging.    We are dealing with more than just compliance issues,
   more depressive symptoms, etc.    Thank you for sharing!   This
   community is always an encouragement to me.   We have good days and
   bad.. the bad are bad.. wish they would get less and less.. but more
   downs than up right now.

   Thank you so much for posting those. It's been awhile since I have
   checked out the boards on here. My son was diagnosed type 1 in August
   of last year at the age of two. He turned three in November and we have
   had our ups and downs as most have. The last few days have been a
   little rough with his sugars being pretty high after counting every
   little carb he consumes and dosing appropriately. For some reason I
   logged in tonight after trying to find more research on diabetes and
   read these lovely poems. I can't remember the last time so many tears
   fell from my eyes. Not from being sad, just tears of knowing I am not
   alone. Thank you.

   I"m bumping this thread up again, so many many new parents of children
   with Type1 and I KNOW they can use the lift.  Just letting you know,
   you're not alone in this journey.  Even if we don't always answer a
   thread or give advise, we're here and we care and we know just how
   you're feeling because we've been through it too.   We really really
   'get it!'  Smiley Wink


   Another thing you might want to look at some time, after you've calmed
   down from the Dx, is the following program(s).  They tell alot about
   Type1, how long it's been around, and about the discovery of how to
   treat it.  Its fasinating to watch!  It makes you realize how far
   medical advances have come since then.   For me, it makes each day a
   blessing my daughter's here, even when she's giving me grief about
   helping with the house work! Smiley Very Happy
