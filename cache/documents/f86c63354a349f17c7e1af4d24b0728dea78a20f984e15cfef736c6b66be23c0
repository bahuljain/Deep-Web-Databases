       This article needs additional citations for verification.
       Please help improve this article by adding reliable references.
       Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2006)
       Look up Multimedia in
       Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
       Multimedia (Lat. Multum + Medium) is media that uses multiple forms
       of information content and information processing (e.g. text,
       audio, graphics, animation, video, interactivity) to inform or
       entertain the (user) audience. Multimedia also refers to the use of
       (but not limited to) electronic media to store and experience
       multimedia content. Multimedia is similar to traditional mixed
       media in fine art, but with a broader scope. The term "rich media"
       is synonymous for interactive multimedia. Multimedia means that
       computer info can be represented through audio, graphics, image,
       video and animation in addition to traditional media(text and
       graphics). Hypermedia can be considered one particular multimedia
       application.
       Categorization
       Linear
       Presentation
       Non-linear
       Interactive
       Multimedia may be broadly divided into linear and non-linear
       categories. Linear active content progresses without any navigation
       control for the viewer such as a cinema presentation. Non-linear
       content offers user interactivity to control progress as used with
       a computer game or used in self-paced computer based training.
       Non-linear content is also known as hypermedia content.
       Multimedia presentations can be live or recorded. A recorded
       presentation may allow interactivity via a navigation system. A
       live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via
       interaction with the presenter or performer.
       [edit] Features
       Local
       Recorded
       Online
       Streaming
       Multimedia presentations may be viewed in person on stage,
       projected, transmitted, or played locally with a media player. A
       broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation.
       Broadcasts and recordings can be either analog or digital
       electronic media technology. Digital online multimedia may be
       downloaded or streamed. Streaming multimedia may be live or
       on-demand.
       Multimedia games and simulations may be used in a physical
       environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online
       network, or locally with an offline computer, game system, or
       simulator.
       The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be
       intended to enhance the users experience, for example to make it
       easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or
       art, to transcend everyday experience.

       A lasershow is a live multimedia performance.
       Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining
       multiple forms of media content But depending on what multimedia
       content you have it may vary Online multimedia is increasingly
       becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications
       with collaborative end-user innovation and personalization on
       multiple forms of content over time. Examples of these range from
       multiple forms of content on web sites like photo galleries with
       both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to
       simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations
       or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to
       be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and
       hearing, Haptic technology enables virtual objects to be felt.
       Emerging technology involving illusions of taste and smell may also
       enhance the multimedia experience.
       [edit] Terminology
       [edit] History of the term
       In 1965 the term Multi-media was used to describe the Exploding
       Plastic Inevitable, a performance that combined live rock music,
       cinema, experimental lighting and performance art.
       In the intervening forty years the word has taken on different
       meanings. In the late 1970s the term was used to describe
       presentations consisting of multi-projector slide shows timed to an
       audio track. In the 1990s it took on its current meaning. In common
       usage the term multimedia refers to an electronically delivered
       combination of media including video, still images, audio, text in
       such a way that can be accessed interactively.[1] Much of the
       content on the web today falls within this definition as understood
       by millions.
       Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called
       "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive,
       which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of
       video, picture, and audio data.
       [edit] Word usage and context
       Since media is the plural of medium, the term "multimedia" is a
       pleonasm if "multi" is used to describe multiple occurrences of
       only one form of media such as a collection of audio CDs. This is
       why it's important that the word "multimedia" is used exclusively
       to describe multiple forms of media.
       The term "multimedia" is also ambiguous. Static content (such as a
       paper book) may be considered multimedia if it contains both
       pictures and text or may be considered interactive if the user
       interacts by turning pages at will. Books may also be considered
       non-linear if the pages are accessed non-sequentially. The term
       "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is
       ambiguous in multimedia terminology. Video is often used to
       describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format
       instead of the form of information content such as moving
       illustrations or still pictures. Multiple forms of information
       content are often not considered multimedia if they don't contain
       modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise,
       single forms of information content with single methods of
       information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often
       called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish static media from active
       media.

       Virtual reality uses multimedia content. Applications and delivery
       platforms of multimedia are virtually limitless.
       Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but
       not limited to, advertisements, art, education, entertainment,
       engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research
       and spatial temporal applications. Below are the several examples
       as follows:
       [edit] Professional
       [edit] Creative industries
       Creative industries use multimedia for a variety of purposes
       ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to
       journalism, to media and software services provided for any of the
       industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may
       cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their
       skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.
       [edit] Commercial
       Much of the electronic old and new media utilized by commercial
       artists is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and
       keep attention in advertising. Industrial, business to business,
       and interoffice communications are often developed by creative
       services firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple
       slide shows to sell ideas or liven-up training. Commercial
       multimedia developers may be hired to design for governmental
       services and nonprofit services applications as well.
       [edit] Entertainment and fine arts
       In addition, multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment
       industry, especially to develop special effects in movies and
       animations. Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software
       programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some video games
       also use multimedia features.
       Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate
       instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are
       called Interactive Multimedia.
       In the Arts there are multimedia artists, whose minds are able to
       blend techniques using different media that in some way
       incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant
       could be Peter Greenaway who is melding Cinema with Opera and all
       sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of
       multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena,
       such as an art gallery. For the most part these artists are using
       materials that will not hold up over time.
       [edit] Education
       In Education, multimedia is used to produce computer-based training
       courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like
       encyclopaedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series
       of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated
       illustrations in various information formats. Edutainment is an
       informal term used to describe combining education with
       entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.
       [edit] Engineering
       Software engineers may use multimedia in Computer Simulations for
       anything from entertainment to training such as military or
       industrial training. Multimedia for software interfaces are often
       done as a collaboration between creative professionals and software
       engineers.
       [edit] Industry
       In the Industrial sector, multimedia is used as a way to help
       present information to shareholders, superiors and coworkers.
       Multimedia is also helpful for providing employee training,
       advertising and selling products all over the world via virtually
       unlimited web-based technologies.
       [edit] Mathematical and Scientific Research
       In Mathematical and Scientific Research, multimedia are mainly used
       for modelling and simulation. For example, a scientist can look at
       a molecular model of a particular substance and manipulate it to
       arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in
       journals such as the Journal of Multimedia.
       [edit] Medicine
       In Medicine, doctors can get trained by looking at a virtual
       surgery or they can simulate how the human body is affected by
       diseases spread by viruses and bacteria and then develop techniques
       to prevent it.
       [edit] Miscellaneous
       In Europe, the reference organization for Multimedia industry is
       the European Multimedia Associations Convention (EMMAC).
       An observatory for jobs in the multimedia industry provides surveys
       and analysis about multimedia and ITC jobs.[1]
       [edit] Structuring information in a multimedia form
       Multimedia represents the convergence of text, pictures, video and
       sound into a single form. The power of multimedia and the Internet
       lies in the way in which information is linked.
       Multimedia and the Internet require a completely new approach to
       writing. The style of writing that is appropriate for the 'on-line
       world' is highly optimized and designed to be able to be quickly
       scanned by readers. [2]
       A good site must be made with a specific purpose in mind and a site
       with good interactivity and new technology can also be useful for
       attracting visitors. The site must be attractive and innovative in
       its design, function in terms of its purpose, easy to navigate,
       frequently updated and fast to download. [3]
       When users view a page, they can only view one page at a time. As a
       result, multimedia users must create a ‚Äòmental model of information
       structure‚Äô.[4]
       Patrick Lynch, author of the Yale University Web Style Manual,
       states that users need predictability and structure, with clear
       functional and graphical continuity between the various components
       and subsections of the multimedia production.In this way, the home
       page of any multimedia production should always be a landmark, able
       to accessed from anywhere within a multimedia piece.
