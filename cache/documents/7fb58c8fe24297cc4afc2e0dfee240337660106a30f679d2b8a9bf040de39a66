   [118]Kipper to the CUP!
   Best Answer:  PANCREAS
   that is such a big test question!!
   So many people will say the hypothalamus will detect low BSL (blood
   sugal levels) and stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas.
   That is wrong!!! The pancreas does it all by itself and causes the beta
   cells in the islets of langerhans to release insulin into the blood.
   Such a big exam question!! Very common!

       Insulin is produced in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.
       Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans are sensitive to variations
       in blood glucose levels.
       The main mechanism for controlling its release are glucose blood
       levels. Levels normally remain within a narrow range. In most
       humans this varies from about 70 mg/dl to perhaps 110 mg/dl (3.9 to
       6.1 mmol/litre) except shortly after eating when the blood glucose
       level rises temporarily. There are two types of mutually
       antagonistic(work against each other) metabolic hormones affecting
       blood glucose levels:
       Catabolic hormones (such as glucagon, growth hormone, and
       catecholamines), which increase blood glucose
       and one anabolic hormone (insulin), which decreases blood glucose.
       This means that these hormons act to counter each other so blood
       level remian in a certain range. So the conrol mechanism for
       insulin is the action of other hormones, such as glucagon, growth
       hormone, and catecholamines. Which are depedent on blood sugar
       levels, which insulin helps controll
       This is a general answer, the whole metabolic control system
       involving insulin and it exact mechanisms could fill a text book.

       Your pancreas secretes insulin in response to fluctuating blood
       sugar levels. The glycolysis/carbohydrate metabolism pathways of
       individual cells sends signals through the blood stream to the
       brain, which is monitoring blood glucose levels. If the blood
       glucose levels drop, the brain signals the pancreas to release
       glucagon, which in turn affects the liver to start converting the
       stored glycogen to glucose. As the glucose level in the blood
       stream rises, the brain signals the pancreas to produce more
       insulin, in order to carry the glucose into the cells, this also
       affects the liver which increases glycogen stores. It's a negative
       feedback loop of glycolysis and glycogenesis.

       Depends how in depth you want the answer:
       Insulin is made when the blood sugar level is very high. Allows the
       liver to conserve glucose as glycogen.
       Insulin is made the the Beta-cells of the pancreas.
       Insulin binds to GLUT receptors which up-regulate or down-regulate
       the intake of glucose into the cells.
