Aspirin May Not Protect the Heart After Non-Cardiac Surgeries

   By Brenda Goodman
   HealthDay Reporter

   MONDAY, March 31, 2014 (HealthDay News) — Giving aspirin to patients
   around the time of surgery may do them more harm than good, a large new
   study finds.

   Surgery of any kind — not just heart surgery — may raise a person’s
   risk for having a heart attack, research has shown. Doctors often start
   patients on a low dose of aspirin shortly before and after their
   procedures to help prevent those events.

   But the new study, which pitted aspirin against a dummy pill
   (“placebo”) in over 10,000 patients who were having major surgeries
   that didn’t involve their hearts, found that not only did aspirin fail
   to prevent heart attacks, it also significantly increased the risk of
   major bleeding.

   The authors pointed out that many patients were already taking other
   drugs meant to prevent blood clots.

   The most common surgeries in the study were orthopedic procedures like
   joint replacements.

   The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American
   College of Cardiology in Washington, D.C., and jointly published online
   in the New England Journal of Medicine.

   The finding stunned several experts.

   “This is something that has been hotly debated for years,” said Dr.
   Kurt Pfeifer, an associate professor at the Medical College of
   Wisconsin, in Milwaukee. Pfeifer practices perioperative medicine, a
   specialty that focuses on getting patients safely through surgery.

   “The paradigm had shifted a number of years ago to fairly routinely
   operating through aspirin with the idea that we were reducing the risk
   of cardiovascular events,” said Pfeifer, who wasn’t involved in the
   research. “That’s what’s troubling about this study,” he added.

   “This is unexpected,” agreed Dr. Steve Cohn, medical director of the
   Uhealth Preoperative Assessment Center at the University of Miami
   Hospital. “We were thinking aspirin was potentially protective,” said
   Cohn, who was not involved in the research.

   For the study, researchers recruited patients from 135 hospitals in 23
   countries. Half were randomly assigned to take 200 milligrams of
   aspirin just before surgery and then to continue on 100 milligrams for
   up to a month after surgery. The other half took a placebo pill.

   Half of the patients were already taking a low-dose aspirin every day
   when they entered the study. Those patients were told to stop their
   daily aspirin at least three days before surgery and pick it up again
   seven days after.

   The average age of patients who participated in the study was 68,
   almost evenly divided between women and men. About a third of patients
   in both groups had a history of blood clots that had caused heart
   attacks, strokes, or peripheral vascular disease. And nearly two-thirds
   also got some kind of additional blood thinner, typically Lovenox or
   Xarelto, to prevent clots.

   Nearly the same number of patients, about 7 percent, died or had a
   heart attack within 30 days of their surgeries, whether they took
   aspirin or the placebo — 351 of 4,998 patients in the aspirin group
   compared with 355 of 5,012 patients who took the placebo. That was true
   even for patients who were already on a daily aspirin regimen before
   their operations.

   But significantly more patients in the aspirin group experienced major
   bleeding than those who took the placebo — 230 patients versus 188 in
   the placebo group.

   The findings contradict previous studies that found that aspirin could
   help prevent heart attacks after surgery. But those studies were
   smaller, the researchers noted, or looked at surgical outcomes after
   treatments had already been assigned, making their results less
   definitive.

   Researchers say it could be that aspirin does prevent heart attacks
   caused by blood clots, but when it’s given to patients in addition to
   other blood thinners, as is often the case, the bleeding risk cancels
   any benefit.

   Bleeding can also cause heart attacks, explained study author Dr. P.J.
   Devereaux, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at
   McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. A sharp drop in blood pressure
   can seriously stress the heart, sending it into cardiac arrest.

   “The perioperative period is a tricky period in terms of balancing
   these competing physical effects that are going on,” Devereaux said.

   “We should stop aspirin during the perioperative period, because we’re
   only putting patients at risk without an apparent benefit,” he added.

   “Perioperative period” refers to the time shortly before, during and
   shortly after surgery.

   For patients who take a low dose of aspirin each day to prevent either
   first or second heart attacks, Devereaux said the study found that it’s
   safest to resume that regimen eight to 10 days after surgery, since
   that’s when bleeding risk subsides.
