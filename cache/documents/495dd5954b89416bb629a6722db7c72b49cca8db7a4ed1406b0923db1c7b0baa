   Scientists see mechanism for spontaneous HIV 'cure' AFP Tuesday,
   November 4, 2014
   Brigitte Castelnau
   Paris (AFP) - French scientists said Tuesday they had found the genetic
   mechanism by which two HIV-infected men may have experienced a
   "spontaneous cure", and said it offered a new strategy in the fight
   against AIDS.
   Both men were infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), one
   of them 30 years ago, but never developed AIDS symptoms.
   The AIDS-causing virus remained in their immune cells but was
   inactivated because its genetic code had been altered, the scientists
   said.
   The change appeared to be linked to increased activity of a common
   enzyme named APOBEC, they theorised.
   The "apparent spontaneous cure" throws up an intriguing avenue for drug
   engineers, the team said in a statement.
   "The work opens up therapeutic avenues for a cure, using or stimulating
   this enzyme, and avenues for identifying individuals among
   newly-infected patients who have a chance of a spontaneous cure."
   The work, published in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection,
   was carried out by scientists at France's Institute of Health and
   Medical Research (Inserm).
   HIV replicates by invading human CD4 immune cells, which it
   reprogrammes to become virus factories.
   A rare group of people -- fewer than one percent of those infected --
   are naturally able to rein in viral replication and keep the virus at
   clinically undetectable levels.
   They are known as "elite controllers", but the mechanism by which they
   keep the virus at bay remains a mystery.
   The French group looked at two such individuals, a 57-year-old man
   diagnosed HIV-positive in 1985, and a 23-year-old diagnosed in 2011,
   and sequenced their virus genomes.
   Though they remained infected, standard tests could not detect the
   virus in their blood.
   The team found that in both cases, the virus was unable to replicate in
   immune cells due to mutations in its genetic code.
   The researchers suggested spontaneous evolution between humans and the
   virus, a process called "endogenisation" that is believed to have
   neutralised other viruses in humans in the past.
   A similar process has been witnessed in a population of koalas that has
   integrated an AIDS-like virus into their genes, neutralised it, and
   were passing resistance on to their offspring.
   "We propose that HIV cure may occur through HIV endogenisation in
   humans," the team wrote.
   "These findings suggest that without therapeutic and prophylactic
   strategies, after several decades of HIV/host integrations and millions
   of deaths, it is likely that a few individuals might have endogenised
   and neutralised the virus and transmitted it to their progeny," they
   added.
   "We believe that the persistence of HIV DNA can lead to cure, and
   protection, from HIV."
   The approach hitherto has been the opposite: to try and clear all
   traces of HIV from human cells and from cell reservoirs where they
   hide.
   "We suggest that persistence of integrated HIV DNA is not a barrier,
   but on the contrary, may be a prerequisite to HIV cure," said the study
   authors.
   "We propose a new vision of HIV cure through integration, inactivation
   and potential endogenisation of a viral genome into the human genome."
   - Not unique -
   The team said they did not believe the two patients were unique or that
   the phenomenon was new.
   And they called for "massive sequencing" of human DNA, particularly
   from Africans who had been exposed to HIV for longest, to find further
   proof.
   Only one person is thought to have ever been cured of HIV: Timothy Ray
   Brown who had bone marrow transplants as a treatment for leukaemia,
   from a donor with resistance to HIV.
   A baby given anti-AIDS drugs immediately after birth for 18 months, was
   at first also thought to have been cured, but the virus later came
   back.
