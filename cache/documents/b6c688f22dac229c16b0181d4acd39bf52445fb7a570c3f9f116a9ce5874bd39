   Best Answer:  A buffer overrun is a common kind of error that can
   happen to a program... usually one that is not coded well or that is
   having a compatibility issue with your computer.
   The buffer is a space in the programs code.
   Imagine if the space is only supposed to hold 5 numbers.
   Now imagine the program generated 100 numbers.
   If the programmer did not program a way for the program to handle this
   extra data.. the program will report a buffer overrun.
   Did I explain that in simple enough way for you? If not, email me and I
   will write more.
   Basically, what would concern me is the program itself... is this
   fiesta.bin thing a known program and where did you get it from. Because
   ANY program that is good can be re-wrapped with bad code which is
   better known as a virus.
   If you are concerned.... scan the program with an up to date virus
   scanner. If the problem continues you may want to try re-installing it
   and/or contacting the technical support of the manufacturer of the
   program. They will usually have an FAQ page with known issues. You may
   just need a patch that they may have on their website. :)
   Good Luck!
   --
   got your email. If you don't have antivirus or firewall.. I wouldn't be
   going on line. period. Windows has a built in firewall you can use...
   and you could get a freeware antivirus solution like AVG but I don't
   recommend freeware. The error message, as I said, really has nothing to
   do with viruses (in general) so will it happen again? Probably.. if it
   is poorly coded or a compatibility issue. If it's a virus you are
   already hung... ya know? 'cause you've already run it. so if it was a
   virus you would already be infected. I would suggest you at least get a
   freeware solution, scan using an online scanner
   [120]http://housecall65.trendmicro.com and turn on windows firewall. :)
   ps. glad I explained it good :D

       I read about this issue and it seems its a problem with the game
       software. Although like the other person said, you should have a
       firewall and virus software.
       But this particular issue it seems is a game issue and a patch
       issue.
       You can read about it here
