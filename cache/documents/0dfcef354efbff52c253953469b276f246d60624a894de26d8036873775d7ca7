Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer affects the prostate, a walnut-size gland in men that
surrounds the urethra and normally helps produce seminal fluid. Unlike other
cancer types, prostate cancer sometimes grows very slowly. If it's an
early-stage cancer, it may be safe to use "watchful waiting" or "active
surveillance" to monitor the cancer and delay treatment unless it gets bigger
or more threatening. Prostate cancer treatments include radiation, surgery,
and hormone therapy, which can have side effects such as erectile dysfunction
or incontinence.

       Tumors
       By Steven ReinbergHealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Oct. 28, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — In a small trial, a drug designed to fight
       inherited ovarian cancers in women appeared to help some men with
       advanced prostate cancer. Lynparza (olaparib) targets mutations
       that are found in about 30 percent of men with prostate cancer.
       But, it also seemed to benefit men [...]

       (HealthDay News) — Older black men with prostate cancer seem more
       likely to receive poorer quality of care that costs more compared
       to white men, a new study found. Although there was no difference
       between the races in survival from prostate cancer, black men had

       By Alan MozesHealthDay Reporter MONDAY, Oct. 19, 2015 (HealthDay
       News) — A new study finds no evidence that men’s health supplements
       help prostate cancer patients. Although popular, such supplements
       do not appear to lower the risk for experiencing radiation
       treatment side effects; the risk that localized cancer will spread;
       or the risk that prostate cancer patients will [...]

       By Steven ReinbergHealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Sept. 22, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Men with prostate cancer who also have had a
       heart attack may fare better with radiation therapy alone rather
       than with the standard treatment of radiation plus hormone therapy,
       a new analysis suggests. Over an average of 17 years of follow-up,
       men with high-risk prostate [...]

       (HealthDay News) — Relaxed guidelines on prostate cancer screening
       may delay diagnosis and treatment of aggressive tumors, a new study
       suggests. In 2011, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
       recommended against routine prostate specific antigen (PSA)
       testing, to curb over-diagnosis and overtreatment of prostate
       cancer. Since then, PSA screening [...]
