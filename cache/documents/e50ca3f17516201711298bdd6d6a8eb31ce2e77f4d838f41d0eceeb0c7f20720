   harder than just going for stored body fat.

   Best Answer:  Body doesn't burn muscle. and fat comes near the end of
   everything digested, because the fat from your foods is the most
   complex thing to burn down. Your muscles aren't a source of energy for
   your body.

       Depends... If you take in post workout targeted foods, foods that
       have a protein carrier with simple carbs to suppress your cortisol
       during high insulin sensitivity levels, it'll burn fat because
       you'll have charged your muscle. If you don't do anything for the
       exhausted energy stores, it'll cannibalize muscle proteins before
       fat. Check this out:
       http://www.abcbodybuilding.com/magazine/13weekstohardcorefatburning
       diet.htm
       Really nice article if you can read the entire thing.
       Basically, if you work out CONSISTENTLY and eat well you will burn
       fat and build muscle. If you work out randomly and diet poorly your
       body will think it's starving, store fat, get rid of calorie
       burning muscle, and prepare for the worst (or maybe, on a lesser
       level, just not advance much despite your well-meaning, but poorly
       aimed efforts)

       The body uses fat stores for energy, after carbohydrates. If the
       diet is woefully insufficient, it will begin to destroy muscle to
       get energy needs met; however, this kind of muscle destruction is
       very serious, very dangerous to health. In fact, it is what is so
       dangerous with anorexia. Starvation destroys the heart muscle,
       along with other muscle, and eventually when enough damage is done
       to the heart, it fails. So the body will destroy muscle, but only
       as a desperate last resort for energy. Fat is used first because it
       is purely an energy source and easy to convert.
