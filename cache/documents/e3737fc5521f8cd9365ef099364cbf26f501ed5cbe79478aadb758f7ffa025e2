   Best Answer:  I wrote up a solution for you. It's 2 AM so there might
   be a better, more efficient solution than the way I went about mine,
   but it works nonetheless. You had the right idea using for-loops, but
   your code gets really messy and ugly with your if-else statements.
   Also, you set the array to be of length len-1, and then in the
   for-loops you have only a < less than symbol. That means the amount of
   numbers being inserted will be 1 less than what they had intended.
   My solution breaks the program up into two parts for simplicity.
   Simplicity is important in computer programming. The first part is a
   for-loop that takes in the input and puts it in the array and nothing
   else. The second part deals with finding the most frequent number. I'll
   let you figure out how it works.
   One thing to note is that should there be two or more numbers that are
   the most frequent, (ex 1 2 2 3 3 4), only the 2 or the 3 will show up
   as the solution, not both. Again, if you want both to show up, I'll let
   you figure out a solution for that.
   Contact me if you need further assistance.
   import java.util.*;
   public class Array {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
   Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.println("How many numbers do you want to enter?");
   int len=input.nextInt();
   int[]num=new int[len];
   for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
   System.out.println("enter number "+i+":");
   num[i]=input.nextInt();
   }
   int currMaxNum = 0;
   int currMaxFreq = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i < len; i++){
   int currFreq = 0;
   int currNum = num[i];
   for(int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
   if (num[j] == currNum) currFreq++;
   if (currFreq > currMaxFreq) {
   currMaxFreq = currFreq;
   currMaxNum = currNum;
   }
   }
   }
   System.out.println("The most frequent number is: "+currMaxNum);
   }
   }

       import java.util.Scanner ;
       public class MostValue
       {
       public static void main ( String args [ ] )
       {
       Scanner in = new Scanner ( System.in ) ;
       System.out.print ( "How many numbers do you want to enter: " ) ;
       int len = in.nextInt ( ) ;
       int [ ] num = new int [ len ] ;
       int mostCount = 0 ;
       int mostValue = 0 ;

       System.out.print ( "Enter a number: " ) ;
       num [ i ] = in.nextInt ( ) ;
       int count = 1 ;
       for ( int j = 0 ; j < i ; ++j )
       if ( num [ j ] == num [ i ] ) ++count ;
       if ( count > mostCount )
       {
       mostCount = count ;
       mostValue = num [ i ] ;
       }
       }
       System.out.println ( mostValue + " appeared " + mostCount + "
       times" ) ;
       }
       }
       This is tested and works.
       If there is more than one number that appears the same number of
       (maximum) times, the number appearing that many times *first* is
       reported, to change that to *last*, change the last '>' operator to
       '>='.
