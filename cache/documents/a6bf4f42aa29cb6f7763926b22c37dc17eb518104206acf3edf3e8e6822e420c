   Patients shot in hospital beds in 'horrific' S.Sudan civil war: MSF AFP
   Tuesday, July 1, 2014
   Juba (AFP) - Violence in South Sudan's civil war including the
   execution of scores of hospital patients is the worst seen for decades
   and is an "affront to human dignity", Doctors Without Borders said
   Tuesday.
   "The conflict has at times seen horrific levels of violence, including
   against healthcare facilities," said Raphael Gorgeu, South Sudan chief
   for Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, MSF).
   "Patients have been shot in their beds, and lifesaving medical
   facilities have been burned and effectively destroyed. These attacks
   have far-reaching consequences for hundreds of thousands of people who
   are cut off from medical services."
   Thousands have been killed in the conflict in the world's youngest
   country, while more than 1.5 million have been forced to flee since the
   war broke out in mid-December. Peace talks are stalled.
   "The violence carried out against the wounded and sick, and against
   those seeking shelter in hospitals and against medical facilities
   themselves, are not only violations of international laws and
   humanitarian principles, but an affront to human dignity," MSF said in
   a report that examined the situation over the last six months.
   MSF, which has earned a reputation for working in some of toughest war
   zone conditions across the world, said the situation was the worst it
   had seen in years, even during the two decades long war that paved the
   way for South Sudan's independence from Sudan three years ago.
   "Throughout its 30-year history in the country, MSF -- as well as other
   humanitarian organisations and healthcare providers -- has repeatedly
   witnessed violence against staff, patients, vehicles, compounds and
   healthcare facilities," MSF said, noting that at least 58 people were
   killed in the grounds of four hospitals.
   "What has been particularly alarming in the current conflict, however,
   has been the scale and breadth of the violence."
   Aid agencies warn of the risk of famine should fighting continue, and
   cholera is spreading, with over 50 people dead.
   Fighting between forces of President Salva Kiir and troops loyal to
   rebel chief Riek Machar has been marked by widespread atrocities and,
   according to aid agencies, has pushed the world's youngest nation to
   the brink of famine.
   Kiir and Machar committed themselves last month to a third ceasefire
   deal, and agreed to forge a transitional government within 60 days.
   Fighting continues.
