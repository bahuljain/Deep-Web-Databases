   Few people realize that in the [99]murky world of medical billing,
   there is often room for negotiation. If youre paying providers from
   your own pocketbecause you have no insurance, have maxed out your
   insurance, or are seeking treatment out-of-networkits worth asking for
   a discount on services. Hospitals and doctors will sometimes consider
   accepting less than the full list priceafter all, they routinely give
   substantial discounts when the payer is Medicare, Medicaid, or an
   insurance company. Even with an overdue bill, the provider may be
   persuaded to be flexible. Here are some bargaining strategies you can
   try.
   1. Pay today. Go to the billing office and offer to pay with cash or by
   credit card on the spot. “I would try for a 20% discount,” says Larry
   Gelb, CEO of CareCounsel LLC, a health-care advocacy firm. “Often they
   will be obliging because they have a big incentive to get it settled
   rather than to go through a long, drawn-out collection. If you tie it
   to a little bit of a hardship story, you will increase your chances.”

   2. Disclose your family income. You may be uncomfortable volunteering
   information about how much money you make, but if youre facing, for
   example, a $10,000 bill from a specialist, it might help to explain
   that your family of four lives on an income of $50,000. “Compared to
   the person with a net family income of $250,000, the health-care
   provider will look at those two people very differently,” says Marty
   Rosen, a former Aetna U.S. Healthcare executive and a cofounder of
   Health Advocate, a provider of health-care advocacy services to
   businesses and individuals. This is not a good strategy, Rosen notes,
   for families in an upper-income bracket.
   3. Pile on the compliments. “A lot of doctors really respond to
   schmoozing,” says Laura Valentine, director of client services at
   CareCounsel. When she approaches billers on behalf of a patient, she
   appeals to doctors egos with a bit of flattery. She suggests saying
   something like, “I really wanted to have my cancer treatment here
   because my friends and colleagues all say youre the best and the
   brightest. But I have limitations on my pocketbook. Is there any type
   of discount or anything that you can do?”
   4. Use Medicare rates to your advantage. Finding out what Medicare pays
   doctors and hospitals to perform a specific medical procedure will take
   a bit of research, but it is a gambit professional patient advocates
   frequently use. To do it, read carefully, because these steps are
   complicated: First ask your doctors office for the procedures CPT code,
   which stands for “Current Procedural Terminology” and is a code set
   developed and maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) to
   ensure uniformity in describing medical, surgical, and diagnostic
   services. Next, go to the AMA websites [104]CPT search engine to look
   up the Medicare payment for that procedure in your geographical area.
   (For example, the CPT code for one type of breast reconstruction
   surgery is 19361. Searching for the state of New York and the city of
   Manhattan, with the five-digit CPT code 19361, turns up a Medicare
   payment of $1808.76 for the procedure.) You can use that information in
   negotiating your non-Medicare rate, which you should do before the
   procedure. “Whatever you can do up-front is the best,” advises
   Valentine.
   Not only will you have more bargaining leverage pre-procedure, but
   then, should anything change during or after the procedure, the
   hospital will also have a record that they cooperated with you before
   and will more likely be willing to cooperate again. For both hospital
   and doctors bills, a reasonable offer would be 25% above the Medicare
   rate, suggests Nora Johnson, the vice president and director of
   education and compliance for Medical Billing Advocates of America. If
   you are thinking about negotiating a hospital bill, however, consider
   hiring a professional advocate, since hospital bills are considerably
   more complex, Johnson adds.
   5. Use your emotional state to your advantage. You may be feeling a lot
   of stress, but calling an administrator from the hospital an idiot is
   not going to get you very far. Instead, say something like, “I am just
   so frustrated right now. My spouse is ill, and Ive been trying to deal
   with my health plan, but I really want to make sure you get paid too.”
   Chances are, “because of human nature, they will try to help you,
   unless you get someone who is very hard,” says Valentine.
