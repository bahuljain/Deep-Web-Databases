   First, a little about my daughter. She turned 11 in February and she
   has been an avid softball player for the past 4 years. The last two of
   which she has played on two different softball teams. The local little
   league, and a travel ball team that plays against some teams from the
   surrounding counties and states. About 1 week before she was diagnosed
   she had been looking pale, and would complain that her stomach hurt and
   she couldn't eat. I thought that she had a stomach bug, as there was
   one passing through her school at the time. Finally, on March 5th she
   had a softball practice. She was white as a sheet and so
   tired/lethargic everyone noticed SOMETHING was wrong. This was when I
   found out Laura (my daughter) had been passing her lunch off at school
   because she couldn't eat. She had visibly lost weight and at this point
   I was afraid of an eating disorder. I decided that we would go home and
   she would eat something and if she was no better by Monday I would take
   her to the doctor. So, we went home early from practice and she ate a
   peanut butter and banana sandwhich around 9pm. At 1:30 that morning she
   was almost projectile vomititng. Now I was back to thinking stomach
   virus and thanking God my child was not anorexic. Saturday morning,
   March 6, she woke up and said she was hungry but was scared to eat
   because she didn't want to vomit. I handed her a banana and a baggie of
   dry cereal and said this should do the trick. She ate half the banana
   and said she was done. About 15 minutes later she walked into the
   kitchen and said "Mom, I am shaking and I can't stop". This threw me
   into panic mode. I immediately got her in the car and sped to the local
   ER thinking everything EXCEPT diabetes. By the time we got to the ER
   she could barely lift her feet off the ground, and she was slurring her
   speech. It only took them 15 minutes to tell me her blood glucose was
   694 and she was in diabetic keto acidosis. Since she was a new diabetic
   they transferred her by ambulance to the children's hospital where we
   spent a week in pediatric ICU learning how to count carbs, read blood
   glucose, and give injections. They told me her A1C was 11 I believe,
   which meant she had been high for a long while. They let her out of the
   hospital running at about 350 because they said she would be more
   active at home and that would help bring her sugar down. We have yet to
   see her endo. Her appt is not until the 27th of this month. When they
   released her they had her on 4 servings of carbs per meal with 1 unit
   Novolog to one serving and lantus 14 units at night. This was not
   controlling her sugar well at all, as she would be high in the morning
   but the novolog would drop her so quickly after meals she would have
   lowds and have to have extra food. So thankfully her regular doctor
   dropped the Novolog to 3 units at meals and raised her lantus to 18 at
   night. She is staying anywhere between 70 and 139 daily at every check.
   My problem is that i can't get her sugar high enough to play softball
   and keep it that way if I give her Novolog. Last weekend she played and
   I gave her a 5 carb breakfast with only one unit of insulin and then
   her scheduled snack. She played ball and I checked her BG again and it
   was at 300 (which is NOT what I expected) so I quickly gave her her
   scheduled 3 units but only a corrector of 1 half a unit thinking it
   should bring her to around 150 which would be good for a ballgame. An
   hour later her BG was 86. We actually SKIPPED the dinner dose of
   insulin and I figured I could make up for it at beditme, but she never
   needed it. She was at 130 which isn't even on her sliding scale, so I
   gave her the normal lantus dose and went on my way. i figured she would
   be high the next morning. Nope. Normal range and actually hitting
   almost low at 64 between meals. So are we in the Honeymoon period?
   Should I expect all of a sudden for her sugar to skyrocket? I swear if
   it weren't for the shots I would think she was not diabetic at all. I
   just feel like I am getting off way to easy and I am waiting for the
   other shoe to drop. She weighed 95 lbs at ER and has gained back to 110
   which is normal for her height and i try to make sure she is getting
   healthy food although I am still buying the single serving packets of
   things to make it easier on both of us to count. I am curious to hear
   if anyone else experienced this "honeymoon period" how long it lasted
   if it was gradual to come out of or if it just slams into you all at
   once. Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks, Jerri Lynn

   Hi,
   I'm sorry to hear of your daughter's dx. Didn't the hospital or endo's
   office give you a number to call to ask about her insulin dosages? I
   can see that they might not give you an endo appt right away since they
   did all the training and such at the hospital. (We had very little
   training at the hospital and had an endo appt the next day with some
   training.) But they should have you calling in her bg numbers or faxing
   them to them so they can adjust her dosages and answer questions for
   you.
   It does sound like she might be in the honeymoon period but I don't
   really know much about that since Alex didn't have one. But I think
   coming out of it is sort of gradual.
   Sports and D can be tricky. The activity will lower her bg. The
   excitement and stress and adrenaline will raise the bg. And sometimes
   these effects show up during the game and sometimes hours later. All I
   can suggest at this point is don't give insulin during the game. Once
   you figure out her mealtime dosage (and the lantus dose for that
   matter), it will be easier to deal with the sports part. You can give
   her an uncovered snack before a game or you can have her sip on
   gatorade (no insulin) throughout the game. But it will be trial and
   error to see what really works for her, for this sport.
   For now, call the hospital or the endo's office and see if you can get
   some feedback on insulin dosages before the appt.
   Good luck!
   Barbie,
   Mom to Alex, 21 yo, T1 dx at 15 yrs

   Hi I am glad you found us and sorry you have to be here. My son is 15
   and was diagnosed two years ago. We also thought he had the flu. He was
   in DKA and was transported by ambulance to a children's hospital and
   the PICU. He is doing well now.
   The 1st weeks after diagnosis we were in often daily contact with the
   endos office for help with dosage and blood sugar. I think you said you
   do not see the endo for 2 more weeks. In the meantime, do you have a
   number to contact them at with questions? We have an 800 number and one
   of the nurses/diabetes educators always calls right back. We kept a
   daily log of time, blood sugar and carbs eaten along with activity such
   as baseball. In the beginning this was reviewed daily and they would
   determine what the insulin to carb and long acting insulin units should
   be. Also, they can give you guidance on how to handle excercise and
   softball. Insulin to carb ratios change all the time for various
   reasons. We did not understand that when we first came home from the
   hospital. Give the endos office a call with your blood sugar numbers
   and they will help you out.
   Please let us know how you are doing.

   I am keeping a daily log of her sugars, but the only time i called the
   endo was once when i thought Laura was getting sick right after the
   diagnosis. They couldn't get her in and told me just to take her to her
   family physician. I keep reading about "uncovered" snacks. Are these
   the ones that she is supposed to get between meal times or are these
   extra ones she has to have in order to raise her BG? Not sure of all
   the technical terms yet as this is the first forum I have joined. I
   looked at a lot of posts and there seems to be a lot of helpful people
   here with a lot of knowledge on the subject. At this point I am taking
   it day by day using a trial and error aproach and I feel pretty much in
   control of the situation. My daughter does very well making sure her
   sugar is right and eating when she is supposed to. it is almost as if
   it was already a part of our lives. that is why i am afraid this is too
   easy. She really wants a pump, but I have been reading posts about
   those, and they seem super complicated and although i can figure things
   out ok I dont want to throw her into anything she isn't ready to handle
   yet. I also want to know if anyone has an issue with insulin leakage at
   the injection sight? A lot of times when she gets her lantus after the
   hsot the insulin will start to run back out of her arm leg etc. She
   doesn't like to do lantus in the stomach because its such a large dose.
   So far, i just cover this with a band aid and we go on our merry way.
   She doesn't lose much, but I am wondering if I am doing something
   wrong? We have had a couple of super lows (40 48) where she was almost
   to passing out legs tingling shaking and white but she knew there was
   something wrong and we took imediate action. These usually happened a
   couple of hours after a game and i am chalking that up to her body
   still burning sugar after she quits playing. Which brings me to my next
   question. She has to have insulin to help her body use the glucose she
   is ingesting. excercize burns off glucose. So - is it detrimental for
   her body to burn off sugar from excersize? I mean technically i could
   keep her on her diet and just have her excersize all the time to keep
   her Bg down. But that still would not allow the sugar to enter her
   cells. Still learning how this works and i appreciate any and all
   feedback. Once again we had softball practice today and she checked her
   BG (177) had her 4 carb meal and a 3 unit dose of insulin. 45 minutes
   into playing catch she was to 68 and had to have a snakc and sit for a
   few before she could rejoin the team. is it possible that 3 units is
   still too much insulin? I am not going to lower that dose without
   speaking to the endo first, i am just wondering how low a dose they
   could put her on. I mean there is no halfway with htis thing. Either
   you have it or you don't. Once again it brings me to the "honeymoon
   period'. i just don't want to wake up one morning and her be in the
   500s and in DKA again. THAT was scary. Also I have been reading up on
   these 504 plans, and we do not have one. This school year is almost
   out, but I do believe that next year when she starts middle school i
   want to have one in place. i am already catching flak from the school
   nurse because I want laura to have someone walk with her to the nurses
   office for her checks etc since she is so new to this and hasn't seen
   her specialist yet.

   Hi,
   First I want to say to please feel free to call the endo's office with
   any questions, esp about dosages. That is their job.....to teach you
   how to try to manage this disease.
   I'll try to answer your questions.
   Uncovered snacks are any snack with carbs in it when you don't give a
   shot of insulin. So if they have her snacking btwn meals w/o an extra
   shot, those would be "uncovered". Definitely, any glucose you give her
   to bring up a low wouldn't have a shot with it so technically, those
   are "uncovered" but generally people call that "fast acting sugar"
   rather than an "uncovered snack." I mentioned the uncovered snack in
   reference to sports b/c sometimes, to prevent the lows she is
   experiencing, you have the child eat something with carbs (and maybe
   some fat) before a sporting event and then either give no insulin or
   give less insulin than normal. This is something the endo or the cde
   (certified diabetes educator) should teach you at some point.
   I'm glad things are going pretty smoothly for you so far. That's good.
   And that may be a sign that she is in the honeymoon stage.....but like
   I said, I don't know much about that. But as long as she is getting the
   lantus, it is not likely that she will suddenly be in the 500's (at
   least not for any length of time) and she won't go into dka if she is
   taking insulin and you are testing her bg often enough. If she does
   have higher bgs for a time, you can test for ketones to see if there is
   a bigger issue.
   The pump.....we love the pump. And we did not find it complicated to
   learn. Again, the endo and the cde (and the pump company rep) will help
   you learn how to use it and will help get the settings right.
   Insulin leakage.....I hope someone else can help with that. It's been a
   long time since Alex was on shots. I think it's not uncommon but maybe
   injecting it more slowly might help?
   Exercise and bg....yes, exercise can help keep bg down. I know of
   people with type 2 D who use exercise to help control their bg. With
   Type 1, you have to take exercise into account but you can't eliminate
   all insulin shots just by exercising. They NEED the insulin. And now
   might be a good time to point out that insulin isn't like painkillers
   or many other meds......taking more insulin doesn't mean that someone's
   diabetes is getting worse. While if I have a headache, I may decide
   that I need to take more tylenol when the headache is worse. Or if I
   have some other pain, I may end up having to take something stronger
   than tylenol b/c it's not helping the pain. The amount of insulin just
   depends on many factors....size of person, hormones (ie going thru
   puberty usually means more insulin), the amount and type of food eaten,
   etc. Does that make sense?
   But I do think she needs less insulin before her softball practices and
   games. Call the endo to ask how to deal with it.
   And others can answer 504 plan questions better than me. I do think she
   will need one. And it's actually very reasonable to ask someone to go
   with her to the nurse's office, esp now. Def even when she's more of a
   pro at it all, she will need someone to walk with her if she thinks she
   may be low.
   I know this is long....sorry.
   Barbie,

   Hi and welcome to this forum. The parents here are awesome and are a
   great source of support and information. One of these days, before you
   know it, you will be in that same place of offering information and
   support.
   As to the insulin leaking out, I was told to hold the needle in and
   count to 5 or 10 slowly and then withdraw the needle. This gives time
   for the insulin to be absorbed.
   Honeymoons can vary from person to person in how long they last. Why
   this time is called the honeymoon period I will never know.
   It sounds like you are doing a great job with everything. Over time
   this change will become the new normal
   As to the 504 plan definitely ask for one. They will protect your
   daughter's rights with regards to her diabetes care, etc.
   And I agree with you about your daughter needing a companion if she is
   walking to the nurse's office due to a low blood sugar. Even better
   would be for her to be able to test at any time and any place and at
   any time and then treat, especially when low. I know you will figure
   things out. You are doing a great job. I am glad you are here.

   Hi and welcome to the place no one wants to be. Glad you found us so
   early in her Dx. Sounds like you're going through exactly what all the
   rest of us did, so never feel alone in this. There's always someone to
   'talk' to here that's been there, done that. Smile
   I don't know about the sports end of the deal, but so many have said
   before they use that Gatorade trick, sipping a little though out the
   playing time with no insulin. Even on the Adult Type 1 board they talk
   about using it for exercise. Just trail and error alot on our parts,
   and thank goodness, kids bounce back so fast it's not funny!
   I mainly wanted to throw this in to talk about that nurse's attitude. I
   agree most certainly she needs a 'buddy' to walk her to the office if
   she's feeling off. An adult one would be best for this, cause I'm
   sure... and you should ask the nurse this... "well, if she goes low and
   passes out, how long would it take someone to find her in the hallway
   if she was by herself?" Crazy
   I know.. sounds bad. I had a situation with my daughter starting high
   school. 3 story building and they thought she should have no problems
   going to nurse's office in basement when 90% of her classes were up on
   3rd floor. I told the principal she needed an elevator pass to use if
   she was feeling bad. He was 'concerned' she would abuse it. I then
   asked him "How would the school district feel if she fell down those
   stairs trying to get to the nurse's office low and/or passed out going
   down them and hurt herself? That would open up a whole case of
   Liability on his and the school's part for not allowing the pass." He
   decided maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea after all to let her have
   one. Cool
   So, don't let them tell you what they are going to do. You need to have
   her doctor, either the family one or the endo, sign the medical
   management plan. (depending on which one is more willing to help
   her/you out with the 504 on how YOU want it). Once they have a doctor's
   orders in place at the school, they are legally bound to follow it. And
   it can change as much as needed as often as your daughter needs it to.
   Monthly, daily, even weekly if her medical needs change as she and you
   are learning to cope with her D.
   Good luck, didn't mean for this to run on but we all want you to know,
   you're in the BEST place for support and/or vent here. **hugs** you'll
   do ok and so will she. BigGrin

   It has been a few days since I have been back. We have been super busy.
   My daughter's softball team is trying to get in extra games so they
   have a chance at All Stars and a state championship, and my son ( who
   is non diabetic) has started his practices with his first baseball game
   coming up on Wednesday. I surely do appreciate all the feedback and
   especially want to thank the person who recommended holding the syringe
   in for a few seconds after the lantus shot. It haw worked like a charm!
   no leakages or worries. Now I wake up in the middle of the night and
   think oh wait did I give her lantus or novolg at bedtime?? i am SUCH a
   worry wart. Needless to say If I dosed her with 18 units of novolog we
   would be in deep trouble, and that hasn't happened. I am going to start
   keeping them in seperate places so I don't have the worry. plus, if I
   ever decided to let someone "babysit" it would worry me to death. Not
   that i expect that to happen. She hasn't been to a sleepover since the
   diagnosis and I don't know when I will feel comfortable letting her,
   besides the fact that none of her friend's parents are at the stage
   they want to be responsible for my daughter's food/medication. So, we
   have the sleepovers here, and laura loves to let the girls watch her
   check her sugar, take her shots, etc. ALL of her friends know how to
   count carbs and there are one or two who know when she is feeling bad
   and can tell you if her sugar is good or not. Iam especially thankful
   for those girls who have taken it upon themselves to learn the ropes
   and stick by laura through thick and thin. I am very grateful that I
   found this discussion board as well. Thank all of you guys for your
   support and for allowing me to be the newbie. We go to the endo for the
   first time this Thursday and I am sure that will be an enlightening
   experience. They sent me papaers to fill out before the appt and it was
   like a book! lol Ah well. Just wanted to pop in and say thank you guys
   and give a little update on our progress. Hope everyone has had a worry
   free day!

   Hi I have been thinking of you and wondering how it is going. Sounds
   like you are doing well. I always had the same fear of mixing up lantus
   and humalog. What we did is keep the lantus, in its box, in a
   completely different area where you had to open a cupboard and look for
   it. Also, when I filled the syringe I always made myself not be
   distracted, visually look at the bottle and the units pulled after
   filling, waited and checked again before injecting. With the blood
   sugar log, we entered humalog (fast acting) units injected and carbs
   each time he ate. You might want to make a daily log where you enter
   time and units of insulin and then you can rest easier knowing what you
   did.

   In regards to mixing up the Lantus & Novolog. My son did do that once.
   Needless to say he drank alot of juice and we did alot of monitoring.
   After that incident we tore the top part of a "Post-It" (the sticky
   part) and wrapped it around the vial so visually it set it apart from
   the Lantus. He has not made the same mistake again.
