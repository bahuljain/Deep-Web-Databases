   The Team Approach to Intensive Diabetes Management

   Meg Bayless, BSN, RN, CDE, and Cathy Martin, MS, RN, CDE


     In Brief

     The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial provided evidence that
     improved metabolic control is feasible in the context of a team
     approach to intensive diabetes management. This article reviews the
     interdisciplinary diabetes team concept and encourages a collaborative
     perspective as the model for adequate diabetes care.

   The number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the United States is
   expected to increase, perhaps by 2 million, as a direct result of
   changes made earlier this year to diabetes screening recommendations
   and diagnostic criteria.1 These revised methods will allow timely
   diagnosis of diabetes and give the health care system an unprecedented
   opportunity to initiate metabolic control before the onset of
   complications.

   This influx of newly diagnosed individuals is in addition to the 8
   million people already diagnosed with diabetes. With annual costs
   related to diabetes exceeding $90 billion,2 providing efficient and
   effective diabetes care is increasingly important.

   In 1993, the results of the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications
   Trial (DCCT) provided clear evidence that metabolic control matters for
   people with type 1 diabetes.3,4 This dictum is quickly gaining
   acceptance for type 2 diabetes, as well.5 But as the debate about
   glycemic control and complications is put to rest, perhaps a more
   complex and controversial issue arises: how can intensive therapy be
   implemented for increasing numbers of people with diabetes?

   Broadly defined, intensive diabetes management aims to achieve optimum
   glycemic control using advanced techniques in insulin therapy,
   self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), nutrition, and behavioral
   sciences.6 Intensive management is far more than increased frequency of
   monitoring or an additional injection of insulin per day. It requires
   careful follow-up to monitor progress toward individualized goals and
   support to reinforce management skills and personal efforts.

   Such complexities extend beyond the scope of sole practitioners. It is
   not surprising that intensive diabetes management requires a core group
   of skilled professionals with diverse roles, functions, and
   contributions: the interdisciplinary team.

   The interdisciplinary, integrated care team as a model for the
   treatment of chronic illness is not a new concept. Its benefits have
   been supported in a variety of disorders.7-11 Adoption of this model is
   relatively new to diabetes, however, and requires a shift in how
   diabetes providers view their roles and relationships, both with
   patients and with professionals in other disciplines.

   Recognition of the complexity of diabetes treatment has prompted both
   the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of
   Diabetes Educators to endorse team management as the ideal model for
   the delivery of diabetes care.12,13

   Composition of the Diabetes Treatment Team
   The interdisciplinary, integrated diabetes treatment team includes
   physicians, nurses, dietitians, and behavioral scientists with special
   interest and training in the management of diabetes.5 This core
   membership reflects the basic requirements of diabetes treatment:
   nutrition, medication, self-monitoring, and self-management. Team
   skills are designed to address the regular, recurring needs of most
   people with diabetes.

   Teams may also extend to health care professionals who can help meet
   special or specific needs not within the scope of the core teams
   expertise. For example, podiatrists, exercise physiologists,
   ophthalmologists, pharmacists, or specialists in maternal-child care or
   gerontology may have a place within the diabetes care team.

   The existence of a diabetes care team implies the development of a
   comprehensive diabetes care program ensuring that standards of care are
   met.5 Care should be research-based and outcome-focused. Mutual support
   of team members will encourage ongoing professional development and
   support of critical thinking skills.14

   Leadership, Roles, and Functions
   Integrated care is defined as patient-centered and goal-directed, with
   equal emphasis given to education, counseling, and medical treatment.
   (See Table 1.) Key elements of the interdisciplinary team include
   shared leadership with common goals, shared professional identity, and
   collaborative, rather than consultative, relationships among members.15

   The movement toward interdisciplinary care requires changes in team
   organization. In traditional medical models of care, the roles of team
   members and the work performed by each member are defined by the
   physician. The interdisciplinary model demands a shift toward shared
   leadership,15 which promotes mutual problem-solving, open communication
   among all team members, and team cohesiveness. Undoubtedly, most
   organizations will still be inclined to identify a physician as team
   leader, but the nature of that leadership role must evolve from the
   traditional physician leadership role.

   The DCCT provided a demonstration of such a change. Initially, the
   physicians were the primary diabetes care givers and directed the
   day-to-day activities of other team members by assigning tasks and
   responsibilities. As the study progressed, however, the physicians
   role developed into that of team builder, with emphasis on development
   of ideas, cohesiveness, and problem-solving skills.16

   Santiago noted that the role of physicians in a diabetes treatment team
   should change and that teams should be available to the wider health
   care system. In his words, the physician should be "a team manager who
   could be replaced without dissolving the existing team. Indeed, the
   team could be organized so that it would serve the needs of many
   physicians, not just the manager, in a given community."16 Such a
   circumstance has long been standard in physical medicine and
   rehabilitation.

   In the interdisciplinary model, registered nurses frequently assume the
   role of care coordinator. In other words, although physicians are
   responsible for the overall medical management of patients and are the
   primary providers for acute medical problems, the day-to-day management
   of the diabetes regimen can be provided by nurses.

   In the DCCT, patients spent more than 80% of their time during
   follow-up visits with nonphysician health care professionals. Patients
   spent about 60% of their time with nurses.

   Responsibilities of diabetes nurse clinicians include but need not be
   limited to providing diabetes education, assisting in the choice of
   insulin regimen, adjusting insulin dosages, teaching patients
   problem-solving skills, helping patients work through self-management
   problems, and developing educational and motivational strategies to
   promote patients independent self-management. Coordina-tors are the
   contact point for care, integrating the unique expertise of other
   disciplines to address patients needs. The role of nurses extends
   beyond the clinic or hospital. Nurses monitor patients diabetes
   management and achievement of treatment goals and provide ongoing
   communication between patients and the wider diabetes management team.

   The role of dietitians goes beyond the identification of an appropriate
   meal plan. Working individually with patients to design meal
   algorithms, dietitians highlight appropriate and realistic nutrition
   and exercise goals, negotiate dietary strategies, and provide ongoing
   patient support, tailoring programs to meet patients lifestyle,
   motivation, and specific needs. Dietary counseling may include teaching
   an individual alteration of insulin doses for varying food intake.3,17
   Ongoing dietitian contact is critical; it is inappropriate to restrict
   dietitian contact to times when a crisis requires diet modification.


         Table 1.  Patient-Centered Function of a Diabetes Care Team
         Support patient self-care efforts and achievements.

            Educate about the disease rocess.

            Promote problem-solving skills.

            Identify resources to promote self-care.

         Develop short- and long-term diabetes care goals.

         Prescribe and implement plan for achieving goals.

            Medication.

            Exercise.

            Diet.

            Behavioral modification.

         Screen for diabetes complications.

            Identify risk factors.

            Refer to appropriate specialists.

   Behavioral scientists (psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, or
   other mental health professionals) play a pivotal role on the team by
   identifying barriers to diabetes self-management, providing assistance
   in setting treatment goals, and helping patients implement the
   management skills needed for intensive diabetes treatment. Behavioral
   scientists also provide counseling services regarding adjustment to
   chronic illness and stress management, diagnose psychiatric illness,
   and screen for learning disorders that might interfere with patient
   comprehension and compliance.

   Collaboration
   Interdisciplinary team care requires the adoption of a shared
   professional identity.15 In the traditional medical model,
   professionals from each discipline approach diabetes treatment from
   their own professional paradigm. In interdisciplinary care, however,
   members share a common professional identity as a part of the team, as
   well as a common purpose.

   Having a shared professional identity does not suggest that members
   give up their unique contributions as physician, nutritionist, nurse,
   or behavioral scientist. Rather, all members bring specific expertise
   and a valuable point of view to the group. It does, however, call for
   tolerance and even encouragement of flexible roles within a team.

   One example of nontraditional roles within a team setting would be
   having insulin adjustments made by a nurse, dietitian, or patient,
   rather than by a physician.18 Routine physical examinations and
   screening for complications may be provided by a nurse or medical
   assistant.18-20 This does not suggest that team members exceed their
   scope of practice, but it does require that all members have a thorough
   understanding of diabetes and its management, be skilled in helping
   patients identify barriers to self-management, and be willing to review
   competencies periodically.

   Conflicting viewpoints on how to define health and illness stemming
   from different professional paradigms could undermine attempts to
   develop an integrated, interdisciplinary program.21 Teams can identify
   and address these core conflicts to develop an effective team paradigm.
   Nevertheless, the blurring of traditional roles permits greater
   flexibility within the team and should help make optimum use of health
   care resources.

   The successful shift from consultative, multidisciplinary practice to
   collaborative, interdisciplinary practice requires that members of the
   team understand the unique nature of each discipline represented on the
   team and respect each disciplines unique input in decision making.22
   Collaborative practice allows matching of provider expertise and style
   to specific patient needs and goals.

   If optimal glucose control of a patients type 2 diabetes is achieved
   through diet alone, then the dietitian could be that patients primary
   provider. In this situation, the dietitian would be responsible for
   assuring that all standards of diabetes care are met for that patient,
   for coordinating the appropriate referrals to do so, and for providing
   the expert advice on dietary intervention for diabetes self-management.

   Similarly, in patients for whom chronic diabetes complications have
   become the focus of treatment (painful, peripheral neuropathy, for
   example) medical/pharmaceutical intervention may become the focus, and
   the principal provider may be the physician or pharmacist. Likewise, if
   barriers to achieving diabetes care goals are psychosocial in nature,
   then visits with an appropriate expert in behavior modification or
   stress management may be more helpful than repeated trips to the doctor
   for a review of blood glucose levels.

   The structure of the interdisciplinary team in the DCCT provided a
   framework for addressing progress toward goals. The study group
   encouraged each clinic treatment team to review all aspects of
   intensive diabetes management when participants were unable to reach
   the glycemic target. The six areas each team was challenged to review
   included patient/ team interactions, dietary issues, appropriateness of
   insulin regimen, psychosocial issues, technical proficiency issues, and
   clinic structure. These periodic reviews, conducted during routine
   staff meetings, allowed all team members to identify problems,
   collaborate on strategies to promote euglycemia while preventing
   hypoglycemia, and mutually agree upon staff-identified priorities that
   could then be shared or negotiated with each patient.

   Outcome Associated With Team Management
   A growing body of evidence supports the value of integrated,
   interdisciplinary team management for chronic illness. The DCCT is
   still cited as a model of integrated, interdisciplinary team care, and
   its design, outcomes, and costs have been thoroughly described.
   16,18,20,23,24 Translating the results as a measure of team care
   effectiveness must be done cautiously, however, because the DCCT was
   not a test of the team care delivery model. In fact, the protocol was
   initially built on a traditional medical model, with physician
   responsibility for outcomes. Further care was delegated to various team
   members.16,25

   The interdisciplinary model present at the end of the study evolved
   over time, with the recognition that optimal application of intensive
   diabetes management required a range of knowledge, skill, and
   enthusiasm that is rarely found in one person.16 Roles and function
   evolved, as did respect for the unique input brought by professionals
   from each discipline.

   It is important to note that, by the end of the study, the majority of
   the care was delivered by nonphysician providers,16 which is now deemed
   appropriate for diabetes management.26 This development provides
   evidence for the benefits of team care as it pertains to attaining
   clear metabolic outcomes.

   The benefits of interdisciplinary team care for people with diabetes
   was demonstrated by Halter and associates in 1993.27 Elderly patients
   with diabetes were randomly assigned to participate either in an
   intensive insulin treatment programwhich included insulin management
   aimed at specific blood glucose targets, a comprehensive diabetes
   education program and a program for social supportor to continue to
   receive standard diabetes care from their usual community resources.
   Subjects assigned to the intensive treatment group were able to
   significantly improve their glycemic control as compared to the
   standard care group.

   Similar beneficial effects of an integrated, interdisciplinary approach
   to chronic disease management have been demonstrated with conditions
   other than diabetes. These include but are by no means limited to
   chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, mental
   illness, and care of the frail elderly.7-11,27,28

   In two non-randomized studies of chronic pain, interdisciplinary pain
   management led to an improved sense of control over pain and decreased
   perceptions of pain as interfering with activities of daily living.
   These benefits were achieved despite no lessening of pain perception
   scores.10,28

   Another non-randomized study of injured workers with chronic pain had
   similar findings. In addition, workers who participated in the
   interdisciplinary pain program were more likely to be able to return to
   work compared to workers who did not receive pain management services
   through the program. Early entry into the program (<1 year after
   injury) was associated with more favorable outcomes.28

   Integrated care in people with severe mental illness has also been
   shown to be beneficial as compared to traditional intervention models.
   Participants in integrated, interdisciplinary programs were more likely
   to have worked for pay, more likely to have remained in treatment, had
   shorter and less frequent hospitalizations, had greater social support,
   and had greater client and family satisfaction than did subjects in
   more traditional care models.8,9

   Scenario: A 50-Year-Old Woman With Diabetic Neuropathy

   Part 1: Traditional model of diabetes treatment
   D.L., a 50-year-old woman, presented for treatment of intermittent,
   painful peripheral neuropathy of the upper right thigh. Two years
   earlier, D.L. noted a rapid onset of pain and weakness of the right
   leg. She went to a neurologist for evaluation of her pain. The
   neurologist told her she had diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

   The patient told the neurologist that she did not have diabetes. Her
   prescribed medications included glyburide and acetaminophen with
   codeine. The patient consulted with her primary care doctor, who
   in-formed her that she indeed had diabetes and that she was started on
   glyburide 2 years earlier for this reason.

   When she had visited the doctor 2 years earlier, the doctor had told
   D.L. that she had a "high blood sugar level," but did not specifically
   use the term diabetes. Although she had continued to see her primary
   care doctor regularly, D.L. was never given a diet or exercise plan,
   and received no diabetes education.

   D.L. was also a smoker, and she did not exercise regularly.

   Part 2: Team management of diabetes
   Initial interventions. D.L. was referred to and completed an outpatient
   diabetes education program that was recognized by the American Diabetes
   Association. She was also referred to a tertiary care diabetes clinic,
   where she was introduced to a team consisting of a diabetologist, a
   registered nurse who was a certified diabetes educator, a registered
   dietitian, and a social worker.

   On arrival at the clinic, D.L. had an HbA1c level of 9.0% and
   microalbuminuria. She was considering applying for disability because
   of her painful neuropathy.

   After the initial evaluation, D.L. agreed to work closely with the
   dietitian on a negotiated dietary program using carbohydrate counting.
   She received SMBG training and was asked to fax her blood glucose test
   results to the nurse every week. The nurse would share D.L.s blood
   glucose results with other team members in a weekly meeting. The social
   worker discussed the issue of disability with D.L. and her husband. A
   follow-up appointment was scheduled for 1 month.

   Follow-up interventions. At the 1-month follow-up visit, D.L. met with
   the dietitian, social worker, and nurse before meeting with the
   physician. While indicating that she understood the dietary
   recommendations and had worked hard to incorporate dietary changes, she
   reported that she was following them about 60% of the time. She also
   reported that she checked her blood glucose levels 3 times per day,
   with an average mean blood glucose of 170 mg/dl. The issue of
   disability had been postponed, as the painful neuropathy was
   considerably improved. The physician discussed target blood glucose
   levels for her next visit, as well as the need to change D.L.s
   medication to improve her glycemic control.

   The dietitian coordinated D.L.s care through frequent telephone
   contacts and communicated the information to the team at weekly
   meetings.

   Outcome. Over the next 6 months, D.L. was started on lispro insulin
   before meals, with NPH insulin in the morning. The care coordinator
   role was shifted from the dietitian to the nurse after D.L. and the
   dietitian determined that dietary interventions were being followed
   about 70% of the time. (Her target was 80% compliance with the meal
   plan.) D.L.s HbA1c level decreased to 7.3%, with an average SMBG
   reading of 148 mg/dl. D.L. did not pursue an application for disability
   and decided to enter a smoking cessation program with the help of the
   social worker. She is now seen at quarterly visits with the diabetes
   care team.

   Conclusion

   Now that diabetes experts agree that metabolic control matters, early
   diagnosis of diabetes with aggressive treatment designed to achieve and
   maintain near-normal blood glucose control is imperative. Achieving
   these goals requires a better approach to diabetes treatment. It has
   been 15 years since team care was identified as a concept whose time
   had come for the management of diabetes,29 yet a team approach to
   diabetes care is still a rarity.

   Ongoing treatment of diabetes by a multidisciplinary team is feasible
   and facilitates the achievement of treatment goals that will result in
   the development of fewer long-term diabetic complications. Achieving
   these goals does not seem possible using traditional models of care.
   There is no excuse for delay. We must transform team care from an
   abstract concept to a common practice.
