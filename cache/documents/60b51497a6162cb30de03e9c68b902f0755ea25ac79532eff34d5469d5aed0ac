Type 1 Diabetes

Twenty-four million people in the US have diabetes, and about 10% of those
cases are type 1. Type 1 diabetes, which is often diagnosed in children or
young adults, is treated with insulin. Unlike type 2, which is much more
common, type 1 diabetes is unrelated to diet or exercise habits. Type 1
diabetes is caused by an abnormal immune reaction that destroys the
insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.

Type 1 Diabetes News

     * [100]A Deadly Form of Diabetes That Doctors Sometimes Miss
       Addie Parker was a happy 4-year-old who appeared to have the flu.
       But within hours she was in a coma. Tragically, her parents weren’t
       familiar with the signs of type 1 diabetes — extreme fatigue,
       thirst and sweet-smelling breath, among others — in time to save
       their little girl. Soon after she was diagnosed, Addie’s brain
       hemorrhaged. She died six days later, about a month shy of her
       fifth birthday.
     * [101]Stem Cell Therapy Cures Type 1 Diabetes in Mice
       Using an immune-suppressing medication and adult stem cells from
       healthy donors, researchers say they were able to cure type 1
       diabetes in mice. “This is a whole new concept,” said the study’s
       senior author, Habib Zaghouani, a professor of microbiology and
       immunology, child health and neurology at the University of
       Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, Mo.
     * [102]Lucky Dogs Get Shot at Diabetes Cure
       By Serena GordonHealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Feb. 14 (HealthDay
       News) — In news that might one day help humans who struggle with
       type 1 diabetes every day, Spanish researchers report that a single
       session of gene therapy injections cured five beagle puppies who
       had the blood sugar disease. Even four years later, the dogs showed
       no signs [...]
     * [103]Type 1 Diabetes Up 70 Percent in Kids, Study Finds
       Researchers have documented a startling rise in the rate of type 1
       diabetes in one city: Diagnoses in kids younger than 5 jumped by 70
       percent between 1985 and 2004 in Philadelphia.
     * [104]Managing Type 1 Diabetes Can Stress Teens
       Teens with type 1 diabetes may need help as they begin taking more
       responsibility for monitoring their blood glucose levels and
       administering insulin, a new study suggests.
