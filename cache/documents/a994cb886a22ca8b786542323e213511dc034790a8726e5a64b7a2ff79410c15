   Is it better to run on a treadmill or outside on the pavement? It’s an
   age-old question and the truth is there are pros and cons to both.
   There are definitely some types of workouts you can do better or more
   efficiently on a [99]treadmill. However, running on a ‘mill can create
   that aimless, never-ending ‘hamster wheel’ feeling for some. It depends
   on your goals, injury history, and preference, too.

   Here are 6 pros and cons to running on a treadmill versus running
   outside on the pavement or trail.

Pro: The difficulty level is the same

   The question of difficulty level always arises when it comes to running
   indoors versus out. People assume that running outside is empirically
   harder than logging miles inside on a treadmill. However, research has
   proven that [100]setting the treadmill to a 1% incline accurately
   reflects the same energy costs of running outdoors. So, it’s just as
   effective as long as you add a little incline.

   RELATED: [101]15 Running Tips You Need to Know

Pro: It’s easier on your joints

   The smooth, cushioned belt is more forgiving than hard pavement or
   cement. Running on a treadmill can help reduce some of the impact on
   the joints and the body as a whole. This can be especially helpful when
   rehabbing or coming back from an [102]injury. Make sure you ease your
   way back to the road following an injury by alternating treadmill and
   outdoor runs a few times a week, instead of going cold turkey.

   RELATED: [103]7 Running Injuries and How to Avoid Them

Pro: You can simulate race environments

   Many of the more advanced treadmills allow you to create your own
   unique course profile, which you can use to simulate the exact course
   you’re training for. Even if you’re not [104]training for a race, you
   can switch up your workout by choosing a certain trail or terrain from
   around the world, depending on the options, to make you feel as though
   you’re half a world away. You also have no worries of weather,
   temperature, or terrain issues while running on a treadmill, which can
   mean everything if you live in a very cold or wet part of the country.

Con: You could lose your agility

   Although the treadmill might provide your joints with more cushion, you
   don’t get the added benefit of running on [106]uneven terrain or
   pavement. Even if the ground outside might feel flat to you, it never
   truly is. Therefore, your foot and leg muscles are constantly making
   small adjustments to adapt to the changing surfaces. These adjustments
   are great for coordination and balance and will help improve your
   [107]ability to do everyday things. While treadmill running can help
   improve your overall fitness, it won’t mimic the real-life situations
   that are simulated through running outdoors.

   RELATED: [108]Here’s How Much Running Is Healthiest for You, According
   to One Study

Con: You don’t work as many muscles

   Because there is a machine powering the belt, the muscle mechanics
   differ when you run on the treadmill. Outside, you typically rely on
   your hamstrings to finish the stride cycle and lift your legs behind
   you, almost kicking your butt. But on a treadmill, the propulsion of
   the belt does much of that work for you. You use your quads to push
   off, but your hamstrings aren’t firing as much as they would if you
   were running outdoors. If you’re only running on the treadmill, be sure
   that you’re also doing cross training to work the muscles on the back
   of your legs, including your [109]hamstrings and glutes.

Con: It’s boring

   There are no two ways about it: Running inside is boring. Even if you
   have the [111]best playlist or you’re watching TV, it’s just too easy
   to look at that clock directly in front of you—and see that only 30
   seconds have passed since the last time you checked it. (You can try
   covering the display with a towel to keep that clock out of sight).
   When running outside, the time naturally seems to move faster because
   you are literally covering more ground. Plus, you set a literal finish
   line for your run and see it getting closer and closer as you approach
   it. This provides you with a more natural sense of distance and will
   give you that extra push to finish strong when you feel like giving up.
