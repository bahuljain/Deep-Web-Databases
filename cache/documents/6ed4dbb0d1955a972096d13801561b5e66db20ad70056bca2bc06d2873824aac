NFL Athletes at Risk for High Blood Pressure

   May 26, 2009
     __________________________________________________________________

   TUESDAY, May 26, 2009 (Health.com) — They’re bigger, brawnier, and
   faster than the typical male, but are National Football League players
   healthier than other men their age? Yes and no, according to a new
   NFL-funded study that looks at the [116]cardiovascular health of young
   athletes.

   The good news is that NFL players have [117]cholesterol levels similar
   to other men in their 20s and 30s, and their blood sugar tends to be
   even healthier. However, they are much more likely to have high blood
   pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren’t
   professional athletes.

   “It’s a step in the right direction to have this study,” says Justin
   Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and
   took part in the research. “I think the more information we can find
   out and the more studies we can do, the better.”

   The study, published this week in the [118]Journal of the American
   Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more
   players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could
   potentially strain an athlete’s heart in youth or even after
   retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful
   of high-profile deaths.

   In particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised
   concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was
   6’3” and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San
   Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005.

   “He’s sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that
   populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,” says lead
   study author Andrew M. Tucker, MD, the team physician for the Baltimore
   Ravens. “We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that
   case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the
   investigation.”

   Other heavy players—such as defensive end Reggie White—have also died
   at a relatively young age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac
   arrhythmia in 2004.
