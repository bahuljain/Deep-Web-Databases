MAJOR ESC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES ISSUED

   New guidelines have been issued by the European Society of Cardiology
   (ESC) and partnering organizations for the management of stable
   coronary artery disease (CAD); diabetes, prediabetes, and
   cardiovascular disease (CVD); cardiac pacing and cardiac
   resynchronization therapy (CRT), and arterial hypertension.

   STABLE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

   Gilles Montalescot, MD, PhD, Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Paris, France,
   and Udo Sechtem, MD, Robert-Bosch Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany,
   presented an overview of the new ESC guidelines for the management of
   stable CAD [Montalescot G et al. Eur Heart J 2013]. These updated
   guidelines gave added prominence to modern imaging techniques such as
   CV magnetic resonance imaging and coronary computed tomography
   angiography (CCTA) for use in the diagnosis of CAD. Additionally, the
   diagnostic algorithm of patients with suspected CAD is now based on the
   pretest probability of chest pain being related to CAD. Patients at
   high pretest probability of CAD, defined as >85%, do not need to
   undergo a battery of tests before being directed to invasive coronary
   angiography.

   In order to prevent the overuse of CCTA, the guidelines define which
   patients should receive CCTA. CCTA is most helpful in patients at the
   lower range of intermediate pretest probabilities (an intermediate
   pretest probability is considered 15% to 85%) as a noninvasive
   technique to exclude coronary stenoses.

   The guidelines focus on the need to control heart rate in patients
   being treated medically for stable angina. β-blockers or heart
   rate-lowering calcium channel blockers remain the first-line therapy to
   achieve this goal. Second-line treatment includes long-acting nitrates
   and the newer agents such as ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and
   trimetazidine.

   As in the 2006 guidelines, revascularization was recommended for
   patients at high risk for coronary events, defined as an estimated
   annual mortality ≥3% or angina refractory to medical therapy. Before
   any discussion about revascularization, patients should receive optimal
   medical therapy. Moreover, revascularization should only be considered
   in patients with evidence of regional ischemia as assessed by either
   perfusion imaging or fractional flow reserve, said Prof. Montalescot.

   DIABETES, PREDIABETES, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

   Lars Rydén, MD, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, and Peter J.
   Grant, MD, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom, presented the
   new guidelines on prediabetes, and CVD. Produced by the ESC in
   collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes,
   these new guidelines introduce a new recommendation that endorse the
   use of HbA1C levels in the diagnosis of diabetes [Rydén L et al. Eur
   Heart J 2013]. If either HbA1C or fasting plasma glucose is elevated,
   the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. If there is strong suspicion
   that the patient has diabetes but the diagnosis is in doubt (eg, HbA1C
   or fasting plasma glucose is not elevated), an oral glucose tolerance
   test may be appropriate, said Prof. Rydén.

   CV risk assessment has been simplified in the guidelines, and risk
   scores are no longer utilized to categorize people as having low,
   moderate, high, or very high risk for CVD. Patients with diabetes are
   considered to be at high risk for the development of CAD and CV events.
   In addition, patients with diabetes and CVD (eg, myocardial infarction,
   angina pectoris, or peripheral vascular disease) are at very high risk
   of recurrent CV events.

   Recommendations on revascularization have undergone two major changes.
   In patients with stable CAD and no complex coronary lesions, medical
   therapy is recommended before revascularization unless there are large
   areas of ischemia or significant stenosis in either the left main or
   proximal left anterior descending artery. Also, bypass surgery is
   preferable in patients with diabetes who have complex coronary artery
   stenoses or elevated SYNTAX scores.

   Multifactorial medical management is endorsed, including combinations
   of blood pressure-lowering agents that incorporate blockers of the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), statins for the control of
   lipids, antiplatelet therapy, and a combination of glucose-lowering
   therapies. Aspirin is not recommended for the primary prevention of CV
   events in patients with diabetes who are at low risk of CV events.
   Aspirin is indicated for secondary prevention in patients with
   diabetes. Additionally, patients with diabetes who have an acute
   coronary syndrome should be treated with a P2Y12 receptor blocker
   (preferably prasugrel or ticagrelor) for 1 year.

   Prof. Grant then explained that glycemic control should be
   individualized (Table 1) based on the patient. HbA1C should continue to
   be used to determine the need for intensification of diabetes control.
   The target HbA1C is lower (≤7.0%) in young patients recently diagnosed
   with diabetes who have no known CVD. The target HbA1C should be higher
   (7.5% to 8.0%) in older patients with long-standing diabetes and CV
   complications in order to avoid adverse events related to hypoglycemia.

   Table 1. Glycemic Control: Individualized Care

   The general blood pressure (BP) target for patients with diabetes is
   <140/85 mm Hg. In patients who also have evidence of renal dysfunction,
   the target BP is <130/85 mm Hg. A systolic BP target <130 mm Hg may be
   considered in the presence of nephropathy with overt proteinuria.

   Type 2 diabetes and heart failure (HF) often co-exist. Pharmacologic
   management of HF should include a RAAS blocker, β-blocker, and a
   mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, with consideration given to
   supplementing these therapies with a diuretic and ivabradine.

   CARDIAC PACING AND CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY

   Michele Brignole, MD, Ospedali del Tigullio, Italy, delivered
   highlights of the 2013 ESC guidelines on cardiac pacing and CRT
   developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association
   [Brignole M et al. Eur Heart J 2013; Europace 2013]. The Task Force
   created a new classification system for bradyarrhythmias (Figure 1) in
   which the recommendations are dependent upon the patient’s clinical
   presentation (persistent or intermittent bradyarrhythmia) and whether
   it has been documented with an electrocardiogram.

   Figure 1. Classification of Bradyarrhythmias Based on Patient Clinical
   Presentation


   AV=atrioventricular; AVB=atrioventricular block; BBB=bundle branch
   block; ECG=electrocardiogram; PM=pacemaker; SSS=sick sinus syndrome.

   Indications and potential for pacing according to the new guidance
   (Table 2):


     * Symptomatic sinus node dysfunction, with consideration given to
       pacing in the absence of conclusive evidence if symptoms are likely
       caused by bradycardia
     * Third-degree or type 2 second-degree atrioventricular block (AVB)
     * Consider pacing in patients aged ≥40 years with recurrent,
       unpredictable neurocardiogenic syncope and documented symptomatic
       pauses despite alternative therapies
     * Syncope with bundle branch block (BBB) and a His-ventricular
       interval ≥70 ms or pathologic AVB during atrial pacing
     * Alternating BBB, even if the patient is asymptomatic

   Table 2. Indications for CRT in Patients in Sinus Rhythm


   * Patients should generally not be implanted during admission for acute
   decompensated HF. In such patients, guideline-indicated medical
   treatment should be optimized and the patient reviewed as an
   out-patient after stabilization. It is recognized that this may not
   always be possible.

   bundle branch block; LVEF=left ventricular ejection fraction; NYHA=New

   ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION

   The 2013 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension were
   produced jointly by the ESC and European Society of Hypertension (ESH)
   [Mancia G et al. Eur Heart J 2013; J Hypertens 2013]. Task Force chairs
   Giuseppe Mancia, MD, PhD, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy,
   and Robert Fagard, MD, PhD, KU Leuven University, Leuven, Belgium,
   presented the overview.

   Out-of-office BP monitoring takes on a more important role in the new
   guidelines, and should be considered an adjunct to office BP recording
   in the diagnostic evaluation. The definition for hypertension is an
   office BP ≥140/≥90 mm Hg or a daytime ambulatory/home BP of ≥135/≥85 mm
   Hg. One specific indication for ambulatory BP monitoring is a marked
   discordance between office BP and home BP.

   The guidance indicated no treatment for patients with high normal BP
   (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg). A major development was the decision to
   recommend a single systolic BP target of 140 mm Hg for almost all
   patients, reversing the separate targets for moderate- to low-risk
   patients (140/90 mm Hg) and high-risk patients (130/80 mm Hg) in the
   2007 version of the guidelines.

   A greater emphasis on assessing total CV risk is contained in the 2013
   guidelines (Table 3). Additional risk factors such as organ damage,
   diabetes, and other CV risk factors need to be considered before
   initiating treatment and during follow-up. For patients aged ≥65 years,
   there is solid evidence to recommend reducing systolic BP to 150 to 140
   mm Hg, said Prof. Fagard.

   Table 3. Total Cardiovascular Risk Stratification


   CKD=chronic kidney disease; CVD=cardiovascular disease; DBP=diastolic
   blood pressure; HT=hypertension; OD=organ damage/disease; RF=risk
   factor; SBP=systolic blood pressure. Risk factors include age, male
   sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, obesity and family
   history of premature CVD. Asymptomatic organ damage mainly involves
   left ventricular hypertrophy, evidence of vascular damage and
   microalbuminuria.

   There is no specific preference for single-drug therapy, and an updated
   protocol for drugs taken in combination. The beneficial effect of
   hypertension depends largely on BP lowering rather than the choice of
   drug, so no hierarchy of drugs is suggested.

SAXAGLIPTIN AND ALOGLIPTIN NONINFERIOR FOR CV ISCHEMIC EVENTS IN PATIENTS AT
HIGH-RISK WITH T2DM AND CORONARY DISEASE

   Antihyperglycemic therapies have been shown to reduce microvascular
   events (ie, blindness, amputation, and kidney failure); however, their
   impact on macrovascular events (ie, cardiovascular [CV] death,
   myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) has not been well established.
   In addition, concerns of increased risk of CV events with some
   antihyperglycemic therapies prompted the United States Food and Drug
   Administration and European Medicines Agency to require demonstration
   of CV safety for all new diabetes therapies [Food and Drug
   Administration. Guidance for Industry. 2008.
   [[61]http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory
   Information/Guidances/ucm071627.pdf]. As a result, well-powered trials
   of CV outcomes in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
   (T2DM) are being conducted to establish CV safety with new
   antihyperglycemic drugs.

   Saxagliptin and alogliptin, both selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4
   (DPP-4) inhibitors, are incretin-based antihyperglycemic therapies that
   improve glycemic control in T2DM. A meta-analysis of the Phase 2-3
   clinical development trials of saxagliptin suggested it may reduce the
   risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in T2DM but these overall
   findings were based on few outcomes [Frederich R et al. Postgrad Med
   2010].

   The purpose of the SAVOR-TIMI 53 and EXAMINE trials was to determine if
   treatment with saxagliptin or alogliptin, respectively, would be
   noninferior to placebo for MACE in patients with T2DM at heightened
   risk of CV events [Scirica BM et al. Am Heart J 2011; White WB et al. N
   Engl J Med 2013].

   Saxagliptin treatment in patients with T2DM and stable atherosclerotic
   vascular disease or risk factors does not increase the risk of MACE.
   Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston,
   Massachusetts, USA, presented data from the Saxagliptin Assessment of
   Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus TIMI 53
   trial [SAVOR-TIMI 53; Scirica BM et al.N Engl J Med 2013].

   In the international, Phase 4 SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial, 16,492 patients with
   T2DM and a history of or at risk for CV events were randomized to
   receive saxagliptin 5 mg daily (2.5 mg in patients with an estimated
   GFR of ≤50 mL/minute) or placebo for a median follow-up of 2.1 years
   [Scirica BM et al. N Engl J Med 2013]. Eligible patients with
   established CV disease had to be aged ≥40 years, with documented
   coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral artery atherosclerosis.
   Patients with risk factors were eligible if they were aged ≥55 (males)
   or ≥60 (females) years, and had a history of dyslipidemia,
   hypertension, or active tobacco use. Patients were ineligible if
   already treated with incretin-based therapy within the last 6 months,
   or had a history of end-stage renal disease, long-term dialysis, renal
   transplantation, or serum creatinine levels of ≥6.0 mg/dL (530 μmol/L).

   The primary endpoint was a composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, or
   nonfatal ischemic stroke. Secondary endpoints included the primary
   endpoint plus hospitalization due to heart failure (HF), coronary
   revascularization, or unstable angina, and each component of the
   composite CV endpoints.

   The occurrence of the primary endpoint at 2 years was similar in both
   study arms (7.3% saxagliptin vs 7.2% placebo; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to
   1.12; superiority p=0.99; noninferiority p<0.001). The broader
   secondary endpoint was also similar (12.8% with saxagliptin vs 12.4%
   with placebo; HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.11; superiority p=0.66;
   noninferiority p<0.001).

   Individual CV outcomes were consistently similar between both treatment
   arms with the exception of hospitalization for HF, which occurred more
   frequently in the saxagliptin arm (3.5%) compared with the placebo arm
   (2.8%; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.51; p=0.007). Major hypoglycemic
   events (defined when the event required a third party to intervene
   actively) occurred more frequently with saxagliptin (2.1% vs 1.7%;
   p=0.047); however, hospitalizationfor hypoglycemia was similar in both
   arms (p=0.33). Cases of acute and chronic pancreatitis (p=0.77), and
   pancreatic cancer (p=0.095), were infrequent and similar between both
   arms.

   In the EXAMINE trial, alogliptin therapy in patients with T2DM with
   recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) similarly did not increase the
   risk of MACE. William B. White, MD, University of Connecticut School of
   Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut, USA, presented data from the
   Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Subjects With Type 2
   Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome [EXAMINE; White WB et al. N Engl J
   Med 2013].

   In the international, double-blind EXAMINE trial, 5380 patients with
   T2DM and recent ACS (acute MI or hospitalization for unstable angina
   within 15 to 90 days) were randomized to receive alogliptin QD (n=2701)
   or placebo QD (n=2679) and followed for a median of 18 months. All
   patients were currently on antidiabetic treatment with an agent other
   than a DPP-4 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (ie,
   incretin-based therapy). Exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes,
   unstable cardiac disorders such as HF, refractory angina, uncontrolled
   arrhythmias, severe valvular heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension,
   and recent dialysis.

   The primary endpoint of the EXAMINE trial was a composite of CV death,
   nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. The secondary endpoint included the
   primary endpoint plus urgent revascularization due to unstable angina
   within 24 hours after hospitalization.

   The primary endpoint was similar between groups (11.3% with alogliptin
   vs 11.8% with placebo; HR, 0.96; upper boundary of one-sided repeated
   CI, 1.16; superiority p=0.32; noninferiority p<0.001). The incidence of
   the secondary endpoint was also similar (12.7% vs 13.4%; HR, 0.95;
   upper boundary of one-sided repeated CI, 1.14; superiority p=0.26). In
   addition, there was no significant difference between alogliptin and
   placebo for CV death (p=0.21), nonfatal MI (p=0.47), nonfatal stroke
   (p=0.71), or all-cause death (p=0.23). Hospitalization for HF was not
   part of the primary endpoint.

   The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar (~6.6%) between study arms,
   as was the incidence of acute (~0.4%) and chronic (~0.2%) pancreatitis.
   There were no reports of pancreatic cancer occurring during the trial.

   Dr. Bhatt concluded that SAVOR-TIMI 53 demonstrated noninferiority of
   saxagliptin for major ischemic events in patients with T2DM with
   heightened CV risk. Similarly, Dr. White noted that the EXAMINE trial
   found that MACE rates were not increased with alogliptin compared with
   placebo in patients with T2DM and recent ACS. In both trials, the rates
   of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were reassuring. Dr. Bhatt also
   pointed out that further study to elucidate the mechanism behind the
   unexpected increased incidence of hospitalization for HF in the
   saxagliptin arm observed in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 study is needed.

   Science Advisor’s Note: Hospitalization for HF was not reported in the
   primary EXAMINE publication but was recorded as an exploratory CV
   endpoint [White WB et al. Am Heart J 2011;162:2634-53 (Appendix A)].
   Given the results of SAVOR-TIMI 53, further description of this
   endpoint in EXAMINE will be important in determining whether this is a
   class effect and clarifying the underlying mechanism.

CATHETER-BASED RENAL ARTERY DENERVATION – SUSTAINED BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERING
WITH REASSURING SAFETY AT 3 YEARS

   Catheter-based renal artery denervation appears to result in sustained
   blood pressure (BP) reduction with a favorable safety profile in
   patients through 3 years with consistent benefit across age, diabetes
   status, and renal function, according to Henry Krum, MBBS, PhD, Monash
   University, Melbourne, Australia, who presented the final 3-year
   results from the Renal Denervation in Patients With Refractory
   Hypertension trial [Symplicity HTN-1; NCT00664638].

   Although percutaneous renal denervation (RDN), an endovascular
   catheter-based procedure using radiofrequency energy, has been shown to
   successfully reduce BP for 1 year in patients with resistant
   hypertension [Krum H et al. Lancet 2009], its long-term efficacy may
   potentially be attenuated by sympathetic nerve regrowth and functional
   re-innervation.

   The Symplicity HTN-1 was a series of pilot trials designed to evaluate
   the safety and BP-lowering efficacy of RDN using the Symplicity
   catheter system in refractory hypertension. These nonrandomized
   open-label studies were conducted among 19 centers in the United
   States, Australia, and Europe. Inclusion criteria were systolic BP
   (SBP) ≥160 mm Hg, despite full doses of ≥3 antihypertensive agents, and
   estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥45 mL/min. Exclusion criteria
   included type 1 diabetes, known secondary causes of hypertension,
   current clonidine, rilmenidine, or moxonidine therapy, and renovascular
   abnormalities.

   The primary endpoints of the Simplicity HTN-1 were office BP and safety
   data before and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after RDN. The secondary
   endpoints were the effects of RDN on renal noradrenaline spillover and
   renal function.

   Of the 153 individuals enrolled, 65 patients (42.5%) were not included
   in the final analytic cohort because of missing baseline BP data,
   withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death. Results were
   presented for the remaining 88 patients (58%) who successfully
   completed the 36-month study.

   In the 58% of patients who completed the study through to 36 months,
   renal function was demonstrated to remain stable, and few significant
   late-stage adverse events were reported (Table 1).

   Table 1. Late-Stage Adverse Events


   RDN was associated with significant (p<0.01) and sustained BP
   reductions (mean -32/-14 mm Hg) in patients who completed the study to
   36-month follow-up. Still further, 50% of patients were able to achieve
   a target SBP <140 mm Hg (Figure 1). The BP reduction associated with
   RDN was consistent regardless of patient age, diabetes status, and
   baseline renal function.

   Figure 1. Changes in SBP Through 36 Months


   Reproduced with permission from H Krum, MBBS, PhD.

   Prof. Krum concluded that Symplicity HTN-1 is the first and longest
   running clinical trial for RDN to date, comprising the largest cohort
   of patients. Although the proportion of the cohort with follow up (n=88
   of 153) was limited and longer-term evaluation of this therapy in
   blinded control trials is required, the results of this study suggest
   that RDN has a favorable safety profile and sustained BP-lowering over
   36 months in patients with refractory hypertension.

PROMISES AND QUESTIONS IN RENAL DENERVATION FOR RESISTANT HYPERTENSION

   Renal denervation (RDN) is a promising emerging treatment option for
   resistant hypertension, as well as other diseases that appear to be
   associated with sympathetic activation. Alexandra O. Konradi, MD, PhD,
   Almazov Federal Center for Heart, Blood and Endocrinology, St.
   Petersburg, Russia, presented guideline recommendations for the
   diagnosis and conventional treatment of resistant hypertension.

   Prof. Konradi highlighted an algorithm adapted from the 2008 American
   Heart Association guidelines for resistant hypertension [Calhoun DA et
   al. Hypertension 2008] that addresses many important underlying issues
   in the diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension (Figure 1).
   According to the 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European Society
   of Cardiology guidelines, resistant hypertension can be caused by
   lifestyle factors such as obesity, excessive alcohol or sodium intake,
   chronic use of vasopressor or sodium-retaining agents, obstructive
   sleep apnea (OSA), secondary forms of hypertension, or advanced or
   irreversible organ damage [Mancia G et al. J Hypertens 2013].
   Therefore, physicians should screen patients for OSA and agents that
   can increase blood pressure (BP), including nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs, diet pills, and oral contraceptives among
   others. In addition, treatment adherence is highly important and should
   be assessed routinely [Mancia G et al.J Hypertens 2013]. In addition,
   physicians should exclude secondary causes of hypertension when
   appropriate and continually work to optimize antihypertensive regimens.

   Figure 1. Algorithm to Validate Resistant Hypertension in Presenting
   Patients

   pressure; HBPM=home blood pressure measurement; OSA=obstructive sleep
   apnea; Pheo=pheochromocytoma.

   Adapted from Calhoun DA et al. Hypertension 2008.

   Markus Schlaich, MD, PhD, Neurovascular Hypertension & Kidney Disease
   Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia, discussed the principles underlying
   RDN as a treatment of resistant hypertension. When the sympathetic
   nervous system is overactive, norepinephrine acts to stimulate the
   kidneys, heart, veins, and arterioles. Sympathetic stimulation of the
   kidneys results in sodium retention, renin release, and
   vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the heart increases heart rate and
   stroke volume, with chronic activation by norepinephrine leading to
   arrhythmias and left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition,
   norepinephrine affects the metabolism by stimulating lipolysis in
   adipocytes, gluconeogenesis in the liver, altering insulin release by
   the pancreas and rarefaction of the skeletal arterioles.

   Prof. Schlaich highlighted multiple factors that can cause chronic
   activation of the sympathetic nervous system. For example, obesity may
   be associated with chronic sympathetic activation and it has been
   observed that individuals who lose ~8% to 9% of their body weight
   through diet or diet plus exercise demonstrate a significant decrease
   in sympathetic nerve activity [Straznicky NE et al. Diabetes 2010].
   Moreover, ~70% to 80% of patients with resistant hypertension also have
   OSA, and OSA is associated with high sympathetic nervous activation.

   Henry Krum, MBBS, PhD, Centre of Cardiovascular Research & Education in
   Therapeutics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, presented data
   of RDN efficacy and safety. The Symplicity HTN Program included three
   trials that evaluated RDN in refractory hypertension. In Symplicity
   HTN-1, 153 patients with ≥160 mm Hg systolic BP (SBP) despite treatment
   with ≥3 antihypertensive agents and an estimated glomerular filtration
   rate (eGFR) of ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 received RDN [Symplicity HTN-1
   Investigators. Hypertension 2011; Krum H et al. Lancet 2009]. Patients
   undergoing RDN had reductions in office BP with a mean change from
   baseline of –27 mm Hg in SBP and –17 mm Hg in diastolic BP (DBP) at 12
   months (p<0.001) and –32 and –14 mm Hg in SBP and DBP, respectively, at
   36 months (in those patients for which follow up was available 88
   patients, 58%).

   In the Symplicity HTN-2 Study, 106 patients with uncontrolled
   hypertension of ≥160 mm Hg SBP despite ≥3 antihypertensive agents were
   randomized to receive RDN or control treatment [Esler MD et al. Lancet
   2010]. Patients that received RDN demonstrated a 32 and 12 mm Hg
   reduction in SBP and DBP, respectively, compared 30 October with
   baseline at 6 months (p<0.0001), compared with a +1 mm Hg in SBP and no
   change in DBP in patients who received the control treatment (Figure
   2). The randomized Symplicity HTN-3 trial is currently ongoing with
   results expected in 2016.

   Figure 2. Effect of RDN on Office BP in Symplicity HTN-2

   RDN=renal denervation.

   Reproduced from Symplicity HTN-2 Investigators. Renal sympathetic
   denervation in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (The
   Symplicity HTN-2 Trial): a randomised controlled trial. Lancet
   2010;376(9756):1903-1909. With permission from Elsevier.

   Similar results were demonstrated in the EnLigHTN trial, which used a
   different catheter for the RDN procedure. In the EnLigHTN study, RDN
   was associated with a 26 and 10 mm Hg decrease in office-based SBP and
   DBP, respectively, compared with baseline [Worthley SG et al. Eur Heart
   J 2013]. Prof. Krum pointed out that multiple trials support the
   benefits of RDN in resistant hypertension though acknowledged that
   there are several case reports demonstrating no effect of RDN or even a
   paradoxical increase in BP [Baumbach A et al. Int J Cardiol 2013; Persu
   A et al. J Hypertens 2013 (abstr LB01.06); Vonend O et al. Lancet
   2012]. Still further, Prof. Krum noted that there needs to be more
   robust safety analyses and suggested that the findings of the
   Symplicity HTN-3 trial would be very important. There were 4
   complications out of 153 patients in Symplicity HTN-1, which included
   renal artery dissection and access site complications [Symplicity HTN-1
   Investigators. Hypertension 2011]. In addition, reports of renal artery
   stenosis, hypotensive episodes, hypertensive episodes, and death due to
   myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or cardio-respiratory
   arrest have been published.

   Importantly, ~10% of the patients in Symplicity HTN-2 did not respond
   to RDN [Esler MD et al. Lancet 2010]. Prof. Mancia pointed out that
   nonresponse maybe due to a variety of factors such as nonsympathetic
   factors or incomplete RDN. Therefore, it is important to determine
   which patients will benefit from RDN and the completeness of the
   denervation should be assessed.

   Michael Böhm, MD, PhD, Saarland University Hospital, Homburg/Saar,
   Germany, presented other investigational indications for RDN therapy.
   These indications include atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular
   arrhythmias, insulin resistance and diabetes, OSA, chronic kidney
   disease, and chronic heart failure.

   In the Symplicity trials, it was observed that some patients that had
   received RDN experienced improved blood glucose control [Böhm M et al.
   EuroIntervention 2013]. One hypothesis states that due to
   vasoconstriction, blood flow is directed away from insulin-sensitive
   organs such as the skeletal muscle, which can lead to insulin
   resistance. RDN is thought to restore the blood flow to
   insulin-sensitive organs, thus improving insulin sensitivity. In a
   pilot study of Symplicity data, patients with impaired fasting glucose
   that received RDN demonstrated a significant improvement in fasting
   glucose, fasting insulin, and the Homeostasis Model of
   Assessment-Insulin Resistance index from baseline compared with control
   patients at 1 and 3 months [Mahfoud F et al. Circulation 2011].

   In a study of patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease,
   RDN resulted in stabilization of the disease as measured by eGFR
   [Hering D et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 2013]. In chronic heart failure,
   renal norepinephrine spillover is associated with significantly greater
   cumulative mortality (p=0.003), whereas total body spillover was not
   significantly associated (p=0.2) [Petersson M et al. Eur Heart J 2005].
   In AF, RDN appears to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy beginning
   at 1 month following the intervention [Brandt MC et al. J Am Coll
   Cardiol 2012]. RDN also appeared to improve OSA; in a porcine model,
   RDN led to a reduction in atrial effective refractory period-shortening
   and AF-inducibility [Linz D et al. Hypertension 2012]. In a porcine
   model of ventricular arrhythmia, RDN resulted in reduced extra beats
   due to acute ventricular ischemia [Linz D et al. Hearth Rhythm 2013];
   however, reperfusion-induced arrhythmias are not affected by RDN.

   Guiseppe Mancia, MD, PhD, University of Milano-Biccoca, Monza, Italy,
   discussed the reasons behind the popularity and success of RDN, which
   include a robust pathophysiological rationale and evidence in small
   studies of a durable decrease in office BP over 3 years. However, Prof.
   Mancia warned that the long-term efficacy and safety of RDN on BP
   control has not yet been demonstrated and important questions remain
   about fiber regeneration and the long-term safety of multiple renal
   artery interventions.

UPDATE ON DYSLIPIDEMIA AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE

   Despite the use of statins in patients who are dyslipidemic, residual
   risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains increased in many
   individuals [Libby P. J Am Coll Cardiol 2005]. New therapies are
   therefore needed to enhance the current standard of care for patients
   with high cardiometabolic risk [Chapman MJ et al. Eur Heart J 2009].

   Key opinion leaders discussed the role of other available options for
   elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Jean-Pierre
   Després, PhD, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, explored
   the issue of raising HDL-C levels. Although low HDL-C levels predict
   coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in statin-treated patients [Kearney
   PM et al. Lancet 2008], he indicated that the solution to reducing CV
   risk is not as simple as increasing HDL-C levels, since both HDL-C
   particle size and concentration are independently associated with other
   CV risk factors, as well as risk for coronary artery disease [El
   Harchaoui K et al. Ann Intern Med 2009].

   Lale Tokgözoglu, MD, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey, presented
   data from trials on the therapeutic action of fibrates in atherogenic
   dyslipidemia. These agents are agonists of peroxisomal proliferator
   activated receptor-α, a transcription factor involved in fatty acid,
   lipid, and lipoprotein metabolism [Chapman MJ. Atherosclerosis 2003].
   Prof. Tokgözoglu discussed data from two of the largest outcome studies
   in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the Fenofibrate
   Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study [FIELD; Scott R et
   al. Diabetes Care 2009], and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk
   in Diabetes lipid trial [ACCORD; ACCORD Study Group. N Engl J Med
   2010].

   FIELD evaluated the efficacy of fenofibrate in subjects with T2DM
   [Scott R et al. Diabetes Care 2009]. Patients with severe dyslipidemia
   (triglycerides ≥2.3 mmol/L and low HDL-C were shown to be at the
   highest risk of CVD (17.8% over 5 years). Overall, fenofibrate did not
   significantly reduce the primary endpoint of CHD death or nonfatal
   myocardial infarction (MI; relative risk reduction [RRR],11%; p=0.16)
   [Sacks FM. Am J Cardiol 2008]. However, fenofibrate treatment reduced
   the incidence of CV events in patients with low HDL-C or hypertension,
   with the largest effect seen in those with marked dyslipidemia (RRR
   27%; 95% CI, 9 to 42; p=0.005; Figure 1). Risk reductions were also
   greatest in patients without prior CVD [Scott R et al. Diabetes Care
   2009].

   Figure 1. Relative Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Patients in the
   FIELD Trial

   CVD=cardiovascular disease; HDL-C=high-density lipoprotein cholesterol;
   TG=triglycerides.

   The ACCORD Lipid Trial compared statin monotherapy with a statin plus
   fibrate on CV death, nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke in >5500 subjects
   with T2DM [ACCORD Study Group. N Engl J Med 2010; MD Conference
   Express. ACC 2010]. Although there was no significant difference in the
   primary outcome (first occurrence of a major CV event, including
   nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or death from CV causes) with fenofibrate
   compared with placebo (2.2% vs 2.4%; HR in the fenofibrate group, 0.92;
   95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08; p=0.32), two hypothesis-generating observations
   in subgroup analyses warrant attention. Patients who had an elevated
   triglyceride level in the highest third of those studied (≥204 mg/dL
   [≥2.30 mmol/L]) and also had the lowest HDL-C levels (≤34 mg/dL [≤0.88
   mmol/L]) had 31% fewer CV events with fenofibrate therapy (12.4% vs
   17.3%; p=0.03) compared with all other patients (10.1% vs 10.1%; p=NS;
   p-interaction=0.057). Secondly, the effect of fenofibrate was
   significantly modified by sex (p-interaction=0.01), with a reduced CV
   event rate by 16% in men (11.2% vs 13.3%) compared with a 38% increase
   CV risk in women (9.1% vs 6.6%).

   Although these data do not support routine addition of fenofibrate to
   background statin therapy to reduce CV risk in most patients with T2DM,
   they suggest potential benefit in helping to reduce residual risk in
   those with elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C, and perhaps in men but
   not women, that warrants further study [ACCORD Study Group. N Engl J
   Med 2010; Scott R et al. Diabetes Care 2009].

   Philip Barter, MD, PhD, University of New South Wales, Sydney,
   Australia, reviewed data from the large, randomized Heart Protection
   Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events
   [HPS-2 THRIVE; Armitage J et al. Eur Heart J 2013] study that examined
   the use of combining extended-release niacin and laropiprant with
   statin treatment for the reduction of major CV events in more than
   25,000 patients. The study demonstrated no significant reduction in
   major CV events with the addition of extended-release
   niacin/laropiprant to statin. Furthermore, serious adverse events
   (AEs), including increased risk of myopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding,
   stroke, and infection, were reported in ~30 patients per 1000
   throughout the almost 4-year course of the trial.

   According to Raul D. Santos, MD, PhD, MSc, Heart Institute-InCor,
   University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, adjunctive therapy with
   ezetimibe has also been a controversial issue owing to randomized
   trials that have provided conflicting results about atherosclerotic
   plaque regression via carotid intima-media thickness, as well as a
   concern about a possible increase cancer risk [Peto R et al. N Engl J
   Med 2008].

   The Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International
   Trial [IMPROVE-IT; NCT00202878] is a randomized, clinical outcomes
   study comparing simvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg with simvastatin
   40 mg alone in over 18,000 patients with a recent acute coronary
   syndrome followed for a minimum of 2.5 years. The primary outcome is
   time to first major vascular event (CV death, nonfatal MI, hospital
   admission for unstable angina, revascularization >30 days, and nonfatal
   stroke). Data from the study are expected next year.

   Low-dose supplementation with n-3 fatty acids, however, may lower the
   risk of major CV events in post-MI patients who are not treated with
   statins, said Daan Kromhout, MD, MPH, PhD, Wageningen University,
   Wageningen, The Netherlands. He presented data from the multicenter
   Alpha Omega Trial, the first, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
   assess the efficacy of low doses of n-3 fatty acids (400 mg/day
   eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]–docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and/or 2 g/day
   α-linolenic acid [ALA]) on the risk of fatal and nonfatal major CV
   events [Eussen SRBM et al. Eur Heart J 2012].

   In the trial overall, the primary endpoint of major CV events occurred
   in 14% of EPA-DHA versus 13% in placebo (adjusted HR, 1.05; 95% CI,
   0.82 to 1.34; adjusted p=0.72). Although providing additional n-3 fatty
   acids to statin users did not reduce CV events, only 9% of statin
   nonusers who received EPA–DHA plus ALA experienced an event, compared
   with 18% in the placebo group (adjusted HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.01;
   p=0.051). For some post-MI patients who do not tolerate statins,
   omega-3 fatty acids may represent an alternative therapy to reduce
   major CV events that warrants further study [Eussen SRBM et al. Eur
   Heart J 2012].

   Decisions about statin treatment for CVD prevention should be guided by
   anticipated benefits and potential AEs, stressed Guy De Backer, MD,
   PhD, University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium. He presented data from a
   meta-analysis that evaluated results from 135 studies on different
   statins, to determine their comparative tolerability and harms [Naci H
   et al. Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes 2013].

   There was no difference in the occurrence of myalgia, creatine kinase
   elevation, cancer, and drug discontinuations due to adverse events
   (AEs), between individual statins and control. Statin treatment in
   general, however, significantly increased the odds of developing
   diabetes (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.16) and transaminase elevations
   (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.84) [Naci H et al. Circ Cardiovasc Qual
   Outcomes 2013]. Given these data, clinicians should therefore advise
   patients of the modest risks prior to initiating statin therapy and
   monitor for development of these AEs. However, the implications of
   increased incident diabetes remain unclear in these studies, since
   statin treatment substantially reduced CV risk.

   Alberico L. Catapano, MD, University of Milan, Italy, discussed data on
   proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, a new
   class of cholesterol-lowering drugs. PCSK9 is a protein in plasma that
   binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in their
   degradation such that fewer are present on the hepatic cell surface to
   remove excess LDL from the blood. PCSK9 inhibition therefore represents
   a new treatment strategy for dyslipidemia and associated CVD, and of
   the various classes of agents in development, two monoclonal
   antibodies, alirocumab and AMG 145, are in Phase 3, and several more
   are in Phase 2 development (Table 1).

   Table 1. PCSK9 Inhibitors in Development

   Prof. Catapano presented data from the Phase 2 Goal Achievement After
   Utilizing an Anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin Intolerant Subjects study
   [GAUSS], a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 160 patients
   intolerant of statins that evaluated the efficacy and safety of AMG 145
   compared with ezetimibe control [Sullivan D et al. JAMA 2012; MD
   Conference Express. AHA 2012].

   Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 groups (AMG 145 at doses of 280,
   350, or 420 mg; AMG 145 at 420 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg
   plus placebo) and were treated for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was
   the percent change in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline at 12 weeks
   [Sullivan D et al. JAMA2012]. At Week 12, LDL-C levels in AMG
   145-treated groups were significantly lower (p<0.001) than in
   ezetimibe-controlled group. Mean changes in LDL-C levels ranged from
   –40.8% to –50.7% in the AMG 145-only groups, compared with the AMG
   145/ezetimibe group at –63.0% and placebo at –14.8% (Figure 2)
   [Sullivan D et al. JAMA 2012].

   Figure 2. AMG 145-Induced Changes in LDL-C Levels


   Reproduced with permission from AL Catapano, MD.

   Four serious AEs were reported with AMG 145 treatment versus zero with
   control. Myalgia was the most common treatment-associated AE (in 15.6%
   of subjects in the 280-mg group; 3.2% in the 350-mg group; 3.1% in the
   420-mg group; 20.0% in the 420-mg AMG 145 plus ezetimibe group; and
   3.1% in the ezetimibe plus placebo group). Further evaluation of the
   longer-term efficacy and safety of AMG 145 is underway in the FOURIER
   study [NCT01764633], a trial of 22,500 patients with prior CVD.

   Børge G. Nordestgaard, MD, DMSc, Copenhagen University Hospital,
   Copenhagen, Denmark, discussed evidence suggesting that lipoprotein-a
   (Lp[a]) serves as an independent, genetic risk factor for CVD, with
   elevated levels associated with an increased risk of MI [Kamstrup PR et
   al. JAMA 2009].

   In a study of patients without CVD, additional information on
   lipid-related markers (apolipoprotein B and A-I, Lp(a), or
   lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 mass) to total cholesterol and
   HDL-C improved CVD prediction [Di Angelantonio E et al. JAMA2012].
   Furthermore, extremely high Lp(a) levels can further improve CV risk
   prediction beyond conventional risk factors. In another study involving
   8720 patients, Lp(a) levels ≥80th percentile (≥47 mg/dL) significantly
   improved MI (23%) and CHD (12%) risk prediction (p<0.001) [Kamstrup P
   et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2013].

   Prof. Nordestgaard concluded that while the relationship between Lp(a)
   and CV events requires further evaluation to determine its role as a
   marker of clinical risk, therapeutic options for its manipulation
   remain limited, and lipid-modifying strategies such as fibrates and
   statins have limited and variable effects [Nordestgaard BG et al. Eur
   Heart J 2010]. In the short-term (12 weeks), the PCSK9 inhibitor AMG
   145 reduced Lp(a) by up to 32% compared with placebo [Desai NR et al.
   Circulation2013]. Additional data with novel therapies to reduce Lp(a)
   over the long-term and to assess the impact on clinical outcomes are
   needed.

THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF DIABETES DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING

   According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of
   people with the disease is increasing in every country. In 2011,
   diabetes affected 366 million individuals worldwide, and that figure is
   expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. Over 180 million people with
   diabetes (50%) are undiagnosed [International Diabetes Federation. IDF
   Diabetes Atlas: Fifth Edition, 2011.
   www.idf.org/diabetesatlas/5e/the-global-burden].

   The main objective in caring for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
   patients is the prevention of microvascular and potentially
   macrovascular complications with improved glycemic control along with
   management of other risk factors [Konig M et al. Curr Diabetes Rev
   2013]. Diabetes is associated with both kinds of complications,
   affecting numerous organs, including the heart, brain, and kidneys
   [Cade WT. Phys Ther 2008]. While improving glycemic control has been
   shown to reduce microvascular complications, the impact on macrovacular
   complications has been less clearly established.

   Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) is emerging as an important tool for
   formally diagnosing diabetes in the United States [American Diabetes
   Association. Diabetes Care 2010]. Screening for diabetes previously
   performed with standard fasting blood glucose or glucose challenge
   testing may now be done with HbA1C [Preiss D et al. Diabet Med 2011].
   Naveed Sattar, MD, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United
   Kingdom, discussed new ways to diagnose diabetes and identify those at
   high risk using HbA1C.

   The adoption of HbA1C into diagnostic criteria will facilitate diabetic
   screening and may help refine assessment of cardiovascular risk (Figure
   1) [Sattar N, Preiss D. Diabetologia 2012]. As a diabetes risk
   assessment and screening option, it requires no fasting and can
   dovetail with existing vascular screening. This makes it a very
   attractive way to greatly improve early detection and management of
   individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or
   diabetes [Preiss D et al. Diabet Med 2011]. Based on such evidence,
   HbA1C has now been accepted into the European Society of
   Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines
   for the diagnosis of diabetes.

   Figure 1. HbA1C as Diagnostic Criteria Will Facilitate Combined CV and
   Diabetic Screenings

   tolerance; OGTT=oral glucose tolerance test.

   Adapted from Sattar N, Preiss D. Diabetologia 2012.

   As the interplay between CV risk and diabetes risk becomes clearer the
   case for combined diabetes/other CV risk factor screening (generally
   using HbA1C and nonfasting lipids) has now gained support [Sattar
   N.Diabetologia 2013]. Prof. Sattar discussed this and other new
   paradigms in play, including those that obviate conventional wisdom.

   More recent data suggest that the duration of T2DM is associated with
   CVD; both early and late onset of diabetes are associated with
   increased risk; however, only early onset (associated with a duration
   >10 years) seems to portend risk equivalent to coronary heart disease
   [Wannamethee SG et al. Arch Intern Med 2011].

   Whereas blood glucose was once considered a linear risk factor for CVD
   with a dose-response relationship [Levitan EB et al. Arch Intern Med
   2004], Sarwar et al. [Lancet 2010] report that fasting blood glucose
   has a J-shaped relationship with vascular risk, with little if any risk
   at concentrations between 3.90 and 5.59 mmol/L, and risk escalating
   appreciably around current diagnostic cutoffs (ie, 7 mmol/L).

   The ADVANCE trial investigated the relationship between HbA1C and the
   risk of vascular complications and death in patients with T2DM [Zoungas
   S et al. Diabetologia 2012]. The trial found that reducing HbA1C levels
   was associated with lower risks of microvascular events down to a
   threshold of 6.5%, and macrovascular events and death down to a
   threshold of 7.0% (Figure 2).

   complications and death in patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of
   glycaemic thresholds. Diabetologia 2012;55(3):636-643.

   UPDATE ON MANAGING DYSGLYCEMIA IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES

   According to Anna Norhammer, MD, PhD, Karolinska University Hospital,
   Stockholm, Sweden, managing dysglycemia in the coronary care unit has
   evolved with insight from trials of glycemic control in the intensive
   care unit setting. The first DIGAMI trial, published in 1995, showed a
   clear mortality reduction with glucose control during and after the
   acute phase of a myocardial infarction, aiming at blood glucose levels
   between 7 to 10 mmol/L (plasma 7.7 to 11 mmol/L) during the acute
   phase. Since then trials from the intensive ward have reported
   conflicting results when it comes to lowering glucose during
   hospitalization [Malmberg K, Ryden L. J Am Coll Cardiol 1995].

   In 2001, van den Berghe et al. [N Engl J Med] found that intensive
   insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg/dL reduced
   both morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients in the
   surgical intensive care unit (ICU). In 2009, Finfer et al. [N Engl J
   Med] demonstrated that intensive glucose control increased mortality
   among adults in the ICU, with a more lenient blood glucose target of
   ≤180 mg/dL resulting in lower mortality compared with a more intense
   target of 81 to 108 mg/dL. These data demonstrate a consistent pattern
   across care settings of increased CV risk associated with both
   hyperglycemia as well as hypoglycema.

   This year’s European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Diabetes,
   Pre-diabetes, and Cardiovascular Diseases (developed in collaboration
   with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) recommend that
   insulin-based glycemic control should be considered in acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS) patients with significant hyperglycemia of >180 mg/dL
   (>10 mmol/L), with the target adapted in the presence of comorbidities
   [Rydén L et al. Eur Heart J 2013]. In addition, glycemic control that
   may be accomplished by different glucose-lowering agents should be
   considered in DM and ACS.

   Remaining questions, said Prof. Norhammer, include the role and optimal
   level of glycemic control for the outcome in ACS patients; and whether
   it is possible to reduce final infarct size by means of very early
   glucose-insulin-potassium administration after symptoms of myocardial
   infarction. Prof. Norhammar concluded that we should keep measuring
   glucose in the cardiac care unit and suggested that aiming at glucose
   levels between 7.8 to <11 mmol/L should be safe while the risk for
   hypoglycemia probably will increase if targeting values lower than 7
   mmol/L. She also pointed out that a large proportion of patients will
   have previously unknown diabetes and impaired glucose intolerance,
   about 60% of myocardial infarction patients. This is only determined by
   performing an oral glucose tolerance test before discharge [Norhammer A
   et al. Lancet 2002].

   DIABETES AND HEART FAILURE: WHAT ARE THE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS?

   Some 5.7 million people in the United States have heart failure (HF)
   [Roger VL et al. Circulation 2012]. HF causes >55,000 deaths each year
   [Kochanek KD et al. Natl Vital Stat Rep 2011], with significant
   associated costs related to healthcare services, medications, and lost
   productivity [Heidenriech PA et al. Circulation2011]. David Aguilar,
   MD, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA, discussed the
   management options for DM and HF.

   According to Dr. Aguilar, management of diabetes in patients with HF is
   generally is similar to those without HF, but there are
   diabetes-specific issues. These include the appropriate glycemic
   targets in patients with HF, and the appropriate options for
   hyperglycemic therapy.

   Recommendations for glycemic control from the American Diabetes
   Association [Diabetes Care 2013] call for:


     * HbA1C goal below or around 7%, which is considered reasonable due
       to microvascular benefits and potential long-term macrovascular
       benefits if glucose lowering regimen implemented soon after DM
       diagnosis
     * More stringent HbA1C goals (<6.5%) for selected patients (eg, those
       with short diabetes duration, less risk of hypoglycemia, long life
       expectancy, and no significant CVD)
     * Less stringent HbA1C goals (<8%) for those with advanced
       microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid
       conditions, or a history of hypoglycemia or difficult to treat,
       longstanding DM


   According to Dr. Aguilar, optimal hyperglycemic therapy in HF patients
   is not clear. He noted that metformin can be used with caution, and
   that prospective outcome data are needed for other agents, including
   glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
   given unexpected results from the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial in high-risk CV
   patients.
