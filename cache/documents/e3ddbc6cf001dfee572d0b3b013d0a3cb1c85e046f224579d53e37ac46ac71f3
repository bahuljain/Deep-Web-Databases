   (LARRY DALE GORDON/GETTY IMAGES)
   In the intimidating trifecta of [95]breast cancer
   treatment[96]surgery, chemotherapy, and radiationmany women find
   radiation the easiest to deal with. The idea of having a strong dose of
   radiation beamed at your chest is no one's idea of a good time, but as
   treatment goes, radiation is relatively painless and side effects are
   fewer and more manageable than ever before.
   If external-beam radiation therapy (the most common kind) is part of
   your breast cancer treatment, you'll probably have a 20-minute session
   at a clinic or hospital every weekday for six or seven consecutive
   weeks. It will go something like this:
   Day one
   To start off, you'll be measured so that your radiation oncologist and
   his technicians will know exactly where to aim the radiation beam and
   how to calibrate the correct dosage. "We do a CAT scan of the breast,
   heart, and lungs just to see where the structures are," says Jay L.
   Bosworth, MD, a radiation oncologist with the Nassau Radiologic Group
   in Manhasset, N.Y., and a Fellow of the American College of Radiology.
   "And we put tiny tattoo dotsthe size of a freckleon the breast" to
   ensure the radiation is delivered to the right spot every time.
