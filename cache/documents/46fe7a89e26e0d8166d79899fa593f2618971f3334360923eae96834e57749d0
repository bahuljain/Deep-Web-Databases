Should You Be Drinking Milk?

   For many of us, cow’s milk is the first thing we remember drinking, and
   we’ve always been told it’s a healthy choice: It’s packed with calcium
   and fortified with vitamin D, both of which are essential for building
   (and keeping) strong bones. And despite the saturated fat, milk is a
   great source of protein that can keep you fuller longer—and thus might
   help with weight loss. The United States Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) recommends adults have [98]three cups of dairy (including milk,
   yogurt and cheeses) per day for these reasons.

   Yet as you’ve probably heard, the nutritional tide can sometimes seem
   like it is turning on milk, leading some to wonder whether [99]adults
   should be drinking it at all.

   Here are the facts:

Is milk healthy?

   First, there is some evidence to suggest that milk, on its own, may not
   be as helpful for your bones as originally thought. For example, a 2011
   review published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found that
   drinking milk didn’t [100]reduce the risk of fractures in women.

   And a 2014 study in The BMJ suggested that women who drink a lot
   of milk may actually have a higher fracture risk and a higher risk of
   death compared to those who drink less. To reach their findings,
   researchers looked at data from more than 61,000 women (and about
   45,300 men) who had filled out a series of food frequency
   questionnaires over two decades. In the end, drinking [101]three or
   more glasses of milk per day was associated with a higher incidence of
   hip fracture for women (but not men) and an increased risk of death
   from any cause (for both men and women), compared to those who had less
   than one glass per day.

   This of course made splashy headlines: [103]too much milk can kill?
   But that’s an oversimplification. The study found an association, yes,
   but it doesn’t prove that milk’s the problem. “It may be that
   [104]people who drink more milk differ in other ways from their
   counterparts… These other differences, rather than milk per se, might
   actually account for the health outcomes observed,” David Katz, MD, the
   founding director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research
   Center, explained in an editorial for U.S. News &World Report. Even the
   study’s authors recommended “cautious interpretation” of their results.

   And it’s important to note these are just two studies in a sea of
   dietary research showing that [105]consuming milk and dairy is one of
   the easiest and fastest ways to get to the recommended daily amount of
   1,000 mg of calcium, a nutrient that is without a doubt essential for
   bone health.

So, I shouldn’t skip it?

   Unless you are lactose intolerant, you don’t have to cut out dairy. The
   bottom line is that milk can be a part of a healthy diet, Dr. Katz
   wrote in The Huffington Post. For example, the Mediterranean diet
   allows for modest amounts of dairy, and that diet has time and again
   been associated with [107]better heart health and even [108]brain
   benefits. But [109]you don’t need dairy for a diet to be healthy.

   “You could survive without dairy, but there’s no overall consensus that
   cow milk is bad for you,” Lisa R. Young, PhD, RD, adjunct professor of
   nutrition at New York University and author of The Portion Teller Plan
   ($12, [110]amazon.com) explained to Health.

   Translation: there’s no reason to stop now if you like it, and you’re
   not overdoing it.

   More than calcium, Young sees dairy as an ideal opportunity to get
   protein into your breakfast with a glass of milk or a Greek yogurt.
   (Particularly if you’re not eating eggs, beans, or meat for breakfast.)
   Other sources of protein, like nut butter, are nutritious, but can be
   difficult to portion control, she adds.

   This protein boost isn’t enough to suggest adding more dairy to your
   diet, necessarily. But the protein does seem to be what makes modest
   amounts of milk and milk products so [112]helpful when it comes to
   shedding pounds. That’s because, “fat-free milk and yogurt is one of
   lowest calorie sources of protein. It offers a lot of bang for your
   buck,” Young says.

   Staying on the dairy train? Young recommends going for fat-free or
   low-fat versions. Guidelines still suggest limiting intake of saturated
   fat, a recommendation Young gives her clients. If you’re going to have
   yogurt, for example, stir in walnuts for extra protein, healthy fats,
   and staying power. “I’d rather you save the saturated fat for the
   occasional piece of cake,” she says. So, as long as you’re filling up
   on things like fruits and veggies, milk (and cake) fit in, too.

What if I’m lactose-intolerant?

   You’re not alone. About 65% of people lose the ability to [113]digest
   lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy. If you’re skipping milk and
   dairy for any reason—you’re lactose intolerant, you’re vegan, or you
   don’t like the taste—that’s completely fine, too. There are other foods
   that will get the job done, as long as you plan out your diet to get
   the recommended 1,000 mg of calcium per day.

   Go for foods like dark leafy greens, tofu, and almonds. And, aim to
   fill your diet with vitamin D foods, since milk is normally fortified
   with D. Look for sources like salmon, fortified OJ, and whole eggs,
   Young says.

What about milk alternatives?

   Almond, soy or rice milk are not necessarily even trades, Young says.

   Many are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, making them comparable
   to milk. But the downside is that many don’t come close in terms of
   protein, even when protein is added during processing. For example,
   almond milk typically contains just 1 gram of protein per cup, compared
   to [115]8 grams in regular milk. But some versions add pea protein to
   the mix [116]to boost it to 5 grams. So just keep that in mind.

   You also have to watch the sugar content, since some sweetened
   alternative milks can contain a couple teaspoons or more of added sweet
   stuff, Young says. If you do go this route, make sure to buy
   unsweetened milk, Young says.
