Get Fit Fast with This 10-Minute Step Workout

   One of the greatest pieces of workout equipment can be found in your
   home: the step! A step workout is an amazing way to cross train. It
   allows you to work your entire body while providing killer [99]cardio
   and [100]strength-training. Curious? Lace up your sneakers, and head to
   the staircase. It only takes 10 minutes to improve your cardiovascular
   health and get toned up for summertime. Of course, you can also try
   these moves at the gym with a set of aerobic steps.

   1. Side step-ups
   Stand to the left of a stair, then step up with your left foot while
   driving your right knee up toward your chest. Lower your right foot
   back to the ground, and return to starting position. Repeat for  30
   seconds, then switch legs. Do 3 sets total. Move quickly and try to do
   as many step-ups as you can in 30 seconds.

   SIDE-STEP-UP-1 SIDE-STEP-UP-2

   2. Incline push-ups
   Get into [101]push-up position with your hands shoulder width-apart and
   your back flat. However, instead of having your hands flat on the
   ground, place your hands on the step. By putting your push-ups on an
   incline, you will work different muscle groups. The lower the step, the
   harder it is. Need to make it easier? Put your hands on a higher step.
   Do 30 seconds of push-ups, taking a quick break in between, then do
   another 30 seconds.

   INCLINE-PUSHUP

   3. Uneven squat jumps
   Stand to the left of a staircase with your left foot on the bottom step
   and your right foot on the ground. From here, lower into a squat
   position until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Now for the
   fun part: Explode upward, jumping so that both of your feet leave the
   ground. When you land, lower back into a squat. (If the jump is too
   difficult, start with the [102]squats only, and build your way up by
   adding in a jump every few squats.) Repeat for 30 seconds, then switch
   legs. Do 3 sets total.

   4. Step burpees
   Stand facing the stairs, then put your hands on the bottom step, kick
   your feet back into [103]plank position, and do a push-up. Jump your
   feet back toward your hands and stand up. Jump up onto the step. If you
   are working with a set of stairs, try jumping up to the second stair if
   you can. Jump back down to the floor and repeat. Move as quickly as you
   can, keeping your body in a straight, tight line during the plank and
   jumping as high as you can onto the step. Repeat for 30 seconds and do
   3 sets total.

   STAIR-BURPEE-2

   5. Toe taps
   Toe taps are as simple as they sound. Face the stair and alternate
   tapping your toes on the edge of the step. Move as quickly as possible
   so you keep a jogging rhythm as you tap. Do 3 sets of 30 seconds,
   taking a short break in between each.
