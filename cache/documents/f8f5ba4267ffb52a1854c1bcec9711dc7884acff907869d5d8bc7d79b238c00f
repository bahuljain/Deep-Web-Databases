The #1 Fitness Trend Of 2015

   The #1 Fitness Trend Of 2015

   This simple exercise helps you shed fat, makes you stronger, and fights
   back pain—and you can do it anywhere. (Photo: Corbis Images)

   American soldiers have been doing a simple fitness activity since the
   American Revolution, and it’s helped turn our military into the
   fittest, most feared fighting force in the history of the world.

   That activity: rucking, or walking with a weighted pack on your back.
   We think it can actually make you a better man. (And for a complete
   plan to lose 10, 20, 30 pounds or more—along with hundreds more easy
   and effective health, nutrition, and life hacks—check out [80]The
   Better Man Project.)

   The activity gets its name from “ruck sacks,” which is military speak
   for “backpack.” “Rucking” is marching or walking while wearing your
   ruck sack (which is always loaded down with gear).

   In training camps and in the field, soldiers may ruck up to 25 miles
   (or more) a day, grunting a pack that weighs upwards of 200 pounds.

   But to build the body of a Navy SEAL, you don’t have to (nor should
   you) carry a pack weighing the equivalent of grown man. Just add a bit
   of weight to any old pack you have lying around the house, take a walk,
   and you’ll open up a whole new world of fitness.

   “Rucking is great for the average person,” says Doug Kechijian, Doctor
   of Physical Therapy at Peak Performance, in New York City, and a former
   US Special Forces soldier. “It’s simple, and it delivers a lot of
   health and fitness benefits.”

   It Crushes Calories
   For the average guy, a 30-minute walk burns about 125 calories,
   according to the Compendium of Physical Activities. But throw a
   weighted backpack on and take that exact same walk, and you burn about
   325 calories, also according to the Compendium of Physical Activities.

   Just wearing a backpack with some weight in it makes walking incinerate
   nearly three times the calories!

   Think about that. Let’s assume you take three, 30-minute walks each
   week. If you begin wearing a weighted pack, you’ll burn 31,200 more
   calories over the course of a year. That’s the amount of calories
   contained in nine pounds of fat.

   “Rucking will make you look better, no doubt,” says Dan John, a famed
   strength coach located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the author of Can
   You Go? “It’s especially great for fat loss.”

   It Can Relieve and Prevent Back Pain
   If you work out, you will probably experience back pain at some time.
   Why?

   You probably spend a significant portion of your day sitting, with your
   back flexed forward. You get “used” to that position.

   Then, when you hit the gym, if you lift with your back flexed it can
   cause a potentially-painful disc bulge, says Stu McGill, Ph.D.
   professor of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo in
   Ontario and the author of Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance.

   People who have developed a disc bulge often lean forward when walking.
   This makes your situation worse, because your body has to fire your
   back muscles even harder to hold your torso up. “That puts more stress
   on the disc bulge,” says McGill.

   Throwing a weighted backpack on and going for a walk actually helps
   hold your torso up, so your back muscles don’t have to work as hard.

   “The net effect is that less compression is put on your spine, and the
   flexed forward posture that inflames the disc is reduced,” says McGill.
   “And it can also work disc gel (a disc bulge is caused by extruded disc
   gel) back into the middle of your disc, reducing the bulge.“

   That, in turn, can help prevent and relieve your pain.

   It Builds Your Endurance—Safely
   Rucking turns your lazy walk into a heart health boosting endurance
   endeavor.

   “The cardio benefits of rucking are comparable to those gained from
   other long, slow distance exercises like jogging,” says Jason Hartman,
   C.S.C.S. who trains Special Forces soldiers for the US Military.

   But unlike jogging—which has an injury rate anywhere from 20 to 79
   percent, according to a study in the British Journal of Sports
   Medicine—rucking actually makes you more injury resilient, says
   Hartman.

   “It builds up your hip and postural stability, and that makes you more
   injury proof in all your other activities,” he says.

   It Makes You Better In The Gym
   “Rucking is the holy grail of work capacity,” says John.

   Learning to effectively cover ground under load is often the missing
   link that can be a game changer for your fitness level, he says.
   “Carrying heavy things is a fundamental human skill that most people
   don’t train.”

   It builds you a more solid foundation of fitness, says John. “And once
   you build the foundation, everything else becomes easier.”

   Yes, many exercises build work capacity. But John likes this one
   because it safely works your endurance while under load.

   It’s Easy (And Inexpensive) To Do
   Maybe every morning you and the dog take a walk, or you commute to work
   on foot, or you consistently go for a post-dinner stroll.

   From now on, simply wear a backpack with some weight in it when you do
   those everyday activities. Simple, right?

   What’s more, most new fitness methods require that you buy expensive
   equipment, gym memberships, or workout programs.

   Not so with rucking. You probably already have a backpack and something
   you could use for weight lying around your house.

   It Gets You Out Of The Gym
   Let’s face it, your average gym workout can become arduous. And once
   your routine becomes routine, you stop caring and your fitness
   plateaus.

   Rucking gets you outside, walking in nature. That’s not only a welcome
   change, it can also reduces stress—according to British research—and
   may help you sleep better at night, according to the National Sleep
   Foundation.

   Outdoor exercise also throws something new at your brain.

   “Modern life overemphasizes convergence. We stare at computers, cell
   phones, and TV screens all day and never let go,” says Kechijian.
   “Rucking outside, having to read terrain and adapt works your brain in
   a totally different way, and that can provide positive changes in your
   brain.”

How To Do It

   1. Choose your load
   A good place to start for general fitness is to use a weight that’s
   equal to about 10 percent of your total bodyweight, says Kechijian. For
   example, if you weigh 150 pounds, load your pack with about 15 pounds.

   Don’t stress too much about going above or below by a pound or two—just
   stay in the general ballpark.

   Once you’re comfortable, you can progress up to 35 pounds, says John.

   “You can go with 35 pounds on your back for days, months, years,” he
   says. “But once you start to sneak above 35 pounds, it can break down
   your body.”

   2. Load the pack
   For weight, you could throw a dumbbell in your pack. Or you can even
   use a couple of bricks or a sand bag.

   If you feel like getting fancy, various online sites offer weight
   plates specifically designed for rucking.

   Wrapping a towel or bubble wrap around your weight will help to
   stabilize it, so it doesn’t shift around in the bag.

   You can use any backpack you have lying around, but if you plan on
   using 35 pounds regularly, invest in pack designed to hump serious
   weight. We like the options from GORUCK.com or Camelbak.com, both of
   which are up to military specifications.

   3. Ruck!
   Now, toss on your pack and go for a walk or hike. You can go as long
   and far as you want. But when you’re just starting, it’s best to ease
   into the activity.

   “Afterwards, you’ll probably be sore in some places your normal fitness
   routine has ignored,” says John. “Expect the muscles around your knees,
   your butt, and your low back to be tender. The upside is that the pack
   puts you into appropriate posture, so you’re working muscles that need
   working.”

   Bonus
   If you want to ruck with a lot of people or increase the challenge,
   GORUCK—a gear and event company started by Special Forces
   veterans—hosts hundreds of rucking events across the country. Those
   range from 6, 12, 24, and 48-hour military-style challenges, to
   distance-based group rucks.
