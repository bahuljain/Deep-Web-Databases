Here’s a Good Reason Not to Have Your Starbucks Delivered

   [99]Starbucks will offer delivery through its mobile app starting in
   2015. I read the news on my office computer, to which I’d been glued
   for a good hour. This is exactly the reason I would never have my iced
   latte delivered. Some days, doing a coffee run is the only time I tear
   myself away from my desktop screen.

   Americans sure don’t need another excuse to be sedentary. We’ve become
   a nation of cubicle potatoes, thanks in part to a shrinking number of
   employees at companies and a heftier load of work. A whopping [100]39%
   of employees eat lunch at their desks and 42% either rarely take a
   lunch break or skip it completely, per a 2012 poll by Right Management.

   RELATED: [101]16 Unexpected Ways to Add Years to Your Life

   As you can guess, being sedentary is pretty unhealthy. Not taking a
   proper lunch break leads to greater fatigue and [102]lack of
   productivity among office workers, found one study from the University
   of Toronto. Staring at a computer screen for long stretches of time can
   cause eye fatigue; one study from JAMA Ophthalmology discovered that
   spending more than seven hours a day in front of a computer can cause
   symptoms [103]similar to dry eye syndrome, mainly because we blink less
   as we gaze at our screens and create a lower concentration of tears.
   This behavior can also cause neck strain and, per my own research, lead
   to desperate raids of the office vending machine and consumption of
   crappy snacks.

   I often down lunch at my desk. And so, hitting Starbucks or Dunkin’
   Donuts (I go both ways) in the afternoon is sometimes my only occasion
   to get my butt moving. As much as I’m glad to join in when a coworker
   takes requests for a coffee dash, I’m much happier to give my eyes a
   break, get some fresh air, and get my body moving. The change of
   scenery recharges me as much as the caffeine does. Well, almost as
   much.

   RELATED: [104]11 Secrets to All-Day Energy

   Starbucks is coming up with all sorts of ways to make bucks these days,
   including a [105]$200 sterling silver gift card keychain on sale next
   week. (How much would you hate to lose that?!) Meanwhile, I’ll just say
   thanks for the delivery option, but no thanks. If anyone would like to
   deliver a masseuse to me at the office, however, I am in.
