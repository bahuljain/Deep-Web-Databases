   Best Answer:  Your number of fat calories are going to depend on what
   type on fats are in the product that you are questioning and what your
   total caloric intake is currently:
   trans: Bad (aka hydrogenated fats) - this is the only one that has been
   stated that the only safe level is zero
   saturated: Bad - usually solid at room temperature, should be kept at a
   minimum
   unsaturated: Good - Will reamin liquid at room temperature,
   -- monounsaturated: May start to solidify during refrigeration (olive,
   peanut, and canola oil, avocados, and nuts)
   -- polyunsaturated: Will usually stay a liquid even during
   refrigeration (vegetable oils - cottonseed, sunflower, safflower, and
   soy)
   The unsaturated oils will help reduce the total and LDL cholesterol
   levels whereas the saturated and trans with work to increase to total
   and LDL levels.
   A general rule of thumb is to keep the saturated fats below 10% of your
   total daily calories with your total fats being ~20% of your total
   daily calories.
   In regards to the number you have above, this is just showing a split.
   The total calories of the product is 120, out of that 120, the calories
   from fat are 110. Therefore the remaining 10 calories are from either
   proteins or carbs. Whatever the product is has approximately 12 grams
   of fat per serving.
   With the concern about the amount of fat in many of todays products,
   this values is calles out specifically on the label.
   This is what the table would look like:
   Total calories: 120
   Fat: 12g...110 cal
   Carb: x g...xx cal
   Prot: x g...xx cal

       Here's a formula to help you figure out how many calories you need
       to eat per day to maintain your current weight:
       1. Take your weight and multiply it by 10.
       2. Take that number and multiply it by 1.2 if you're mostly
       sedentary, 1.25 if you're moderately active, or 1.3 if you're very
       active. That's your target, but bear in mind it's a rough estimate
       -- you may need 150 more or less calories per day depending on your
       metabolism.
       Don't buy the old food pyramid guideline -- it's one reason why so
       many Americans are overweight. Aim for an even three-way split
       between protein, carbs, and fat. For example, if your target is
       1,500 calories per day, you'd want 500 calories each from protein,
       carbs, and fat. Just remember fat is 9 calories per gram but
       protein and carbs are only 4 calories per gram.
       P.S.: Something that's 120 calories total where 110 calories come
       from fat is not necessarily bad for you. It depends on what type of
       fat those 110 calories are made up of. Avoid trans fat like the
       plague, but if those 110 fat calories are mostly monounsaturated or
       polyunsaturated fat, it's actually good for you. If it's high in
       saturated fat, be careful.

       ok for each gram of fat in a food its 9 calories, so if a protein
       bar lets say had 2 grams of fat that would already be 18 calories.
       so there is a chart called the daily values chart and an average
       adults should be consuming about 2,000 calories heres the chart:
       Daily Reference Values (DRVs)
       (Based on 2,000 calories a day for adults and children over 4 only)
       Food Component DRV
       Total Fat 65 grams (g)
       saturated fat fatty acids 20 g
       cholesterol 300 milligrams (mg)
       total carbohydrate 300 g
       fiber 25 g
       sodium 2,400 mg
       potassium 3,500 mg
       protein** 50 g
       sometimes i dont follow the chart but i pay really close attention
       to cholesterol, total fat and saturated fat, because heart disease
       runs in my family, but i try to get all of the protein and
       potassium to fit in one's day
