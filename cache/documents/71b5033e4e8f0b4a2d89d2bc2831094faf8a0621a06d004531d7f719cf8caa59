   Best Answer:  module (mathematics)
   In abstract algebra, the notion of a module over a ring is the common
   generalizations of two of the most important notions in algebra, vector
   space, and abelian group.
   Motivation
   In a vector space, the set of scalars forms a field and acts on the
   vectors by scalar multiplication, subject to certain formal laws such
   as the distributive law. In a module, the scalars need only be a ring,
   so the module concept represents a significant generalization.
   Much of the theory of modules consists of extending as many as possible
   of the desirable properties of vector spaces to the realm of modules
   over a "well-behaved" ring, such as a principal ideal domain. However,
   modules can be quite a bit more complicated than vector spaces; for
   instance, not all modules have a basis, and even those that do, free
   modules, behave significantly differently from vector spaces in some
   respects.
   Modules form the core notion of commutative algebra, which is essential
   in many important fields of mathematics, including
   algebraic geometry,
   homological algebra and algebraic topology,
   representation theory of groups.

       A module is A standard or unit of measurement.
       Architecture. The dimensions of a structural component, such as the
       base of a column, used as a unit of measurement or standard for
       determining the proportions of the rest of the construction.
       A standardized, often interchangeable component of a system or
       construction that is designed for easy assembly or flexible use: a
       sofa consisting of two end modules.
       Electronics. A self-contained assembly of electronic components and
       circuitry, such as a stage in a computer, that is installed as a
       unit.
       Computer Science. A portion of a program that carries out a
       specific function and may be used alone or combined with other
       modules of the same program.
       A self-contained unit of a spacecraft that performs a specific task
       or class of tasks in support of the major function of the craft.
       A unit of education or instruction with a relatively low
       student-to-teacher ratio, in which a single topic or a small
       section of a broad topic is studied for a given period of time.
       Mathematics. A system with scalars coming from a ring.______
       . <programming> An independent piece of software which
       forms part of one or more larger programs. Different
       languages have different concepts of a module but there are
       several common ideas.
       Modules are usually compiled seperately (in compiled
       languages) and provide an abstraction or information hiding
       mechanism so that a module's implementation can be changed
       without requiring any change to other modules. In this
       respect they are similar to objects in an object-oriented
       language, though a module may contain many procedures
       and/or functions which would correspond to many objects.
       A module often has its own name space for identifiers so
       the same identifier may be used to mean different things in
       different modules.
       [Difference from package?].
       2. <hardware> An independent assembly of electronic components
       with some distinct function, e.g. a RAM module consisting of
       several RAM chips mounted on a small circuit board.
