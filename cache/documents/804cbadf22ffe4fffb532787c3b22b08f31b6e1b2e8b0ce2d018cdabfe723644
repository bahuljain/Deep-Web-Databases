   Best Answer:  Muscle is smaller per lb then fat is..
   Here is a photo of 5lbs of fat next to 5 lbs of muscle..
   [120]http://www.3fatchicks.com/forum/attachme...
   Obviously, there's a pretty big difference there. Not only is the
   muscle smaller, but the shape of it is longer and leaner then fat.
   Just like everybody is different because of genetics on where they
   store fat, everybody is also different in how quickly they can gain
   muscle in certain areas. MOST women can never get bulky muscle. By most
   I mean like a good 98% of women. Why? There just aren't the hormones
   available to build bulky muscle. Another difference between fat and
   muscle is that if you decide you don't like the muscle in an area, it
   will shrink and go away if you quit training it. Let's say you do
   abdominal exercises but even with diet you don't lose any fat on your
   stomach and just gain muscle. If you think your waist is to large
   thanks to the overlying fat, you can stop doing the exercise and the
   muscle will go away in a couple of months. Too bad fat doesn't go away
   as easily.. lol
   The chicks from biggest loser exercised everyday, including weight
   training and they look much smaller then they did before..
   Here's some of the girls from it..

       No, because muscle is denser than fat. So a bodybuilder of 300
       pounds looks way smaller than a fat person who weighs 300 pounds.
       If you lost fat and then gained the same amount of muscle, you'll
       look smaller.

       This is a tough question. Muscle is way better then fat.I don't
       think the muscle will be like your fat. Yes, you may become
       thinner.

       Not necessarily. Muscle is more dense than fat, so if you have the
       same weight in muscle vs. fat; you will get smaller.
       Hope this helps! :)
