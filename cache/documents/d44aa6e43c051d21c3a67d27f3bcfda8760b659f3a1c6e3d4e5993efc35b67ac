   Best Answer:  Both of the above are incorrect. Here is a more
   comprehensive chart of insulin types:
   RAPID ACTING: (3 times/day)
   Humalog
   Novolog
   Apidra
   SHORT ACTING:
   Regular Insulin
   Humulin R
   Novolin R
   MEDIUM ACTING: (2 times/day)
   NPH Insulin
   Humulin N or L
   Novolin N or L
   LONG ACTING: (once a day)
   Lantus
   Levemir
   Along with these there are a variety of premixed insulin types
   available. These premixes include a rapid/short acting insulin along
   with a medium/long acting one.
   NPH & Regular:
   Novolin 70/30
   Humuiln 70/30
   Humulin 50/50
   Lispro-Lispro Protamine:
   Humalog Mix 75/25
   Aspart-Aspart Protamine:
   Novolog Mix 70/30
   -----
   Therefore, the differences between Humalog and Humulin are many.
   Humalog is a rapid acting insulin. Humulin can be either rapid or
   medium depending upon whether it is R or N. Humalog is dosed three
   times a day with meals. Humulin N is usually dosed twice a day or maybe
   once a day if newly diagnosed.
   Overall, insulin dosing is very complex and can become quite
   complicated. It is important to follow the schedule that was set by the
   doctor.

       Insulin isophane and insulin regular is a combination medicine used
       to treat diabetes. The difference is their reaction times. Humulin
       R is short acting insulin, regular and it begins to work within 30
       minutes of administering it, peaks at 2.5 to 5 hours, and lasts up
       to 6 hours. Humulin N is intermediate acting insulin in an isophane
       suspension-it begins working 1.5 to 4 hours after administering it,
       peaks 4-12 hours, and can last up to 24 hours in the body. Hope
       this helps.

       BJ Tech above me is wrong. Humalog is the most rapid acting
       insulin, followed by Humulin R and Humulin N. All three insulins
       have the DNA structure of the insulin found normally in the human
       body. All three insulins are manufactured by Lilly. The main
       differences are how fast they respond and how long they last in
       your body. A diabetic needs some sort of fast or rapid acting
       insulin to cover carbs that are consumed and also needs insulin to
       cover glucose made naturally by your body, so either they will need
       multiple daily injections of a combination of both short and long
       acting insulin, or be on pump therapy that injects small amounts of
       rapid acting insulin often throughout the day.

       I believe humulin R and N are fast acting and Humalog is a slower
       acting insulin.
