     1. GENERAL MULTIPLAYER INFO
     _______________________________
     We hope you have as much fun playing multiplayer games of Descent 3
     as
     we do! This demo includes Capture-The-Flag and Anarchy games. The
     full version of the game of course includes new multiplayer games,
     weapons, powerups, and multiplayer levels!
     You can play multiplayer games of Descent 3 on a LAN (Local Area
     Network), over the Internet via your modem connection to an ISP
     (Internet Service Provider), or directly against another single
     computer via a modem or serial cable connection. If you're playing
     over the Internet, you can use the free matching service from
     Parallax Online ("PXO" for short) to find other Descent 3 players on
     the Internet to play against. PXO works with when connecting to the
     Internet via modem, cable modem, ISDN, or other connection.
     For this demo, we recommend 8 players or fewer in a network game.
     This file contains details on how to start (or join) a multiplayer
     game, and also contains troubleshooting suggestions, and all the
     details on the many multiplayer menus and options available while
     playing.
     __________________________________
     2. STARTING A MULTIPLAYER GAME
     __________________________________
     After you click "Multiplayer" from the main menu, a dialog presents
     you with several options:
     Parallax Online: Play over the Internet via the PXO
     matching service
     DirectPlay Serial: Play against one other computer over a
     serial cable
     DirectPlay Modem: Play against one other computer over the
     modem
     IPX: Play over a LAN using the IPX network
     protocol
     Direct TCP/IP: Play over a LAN or the Internet using the
     TCP/IP network protocol
     Click the type of game you want to play and then click OK. Following
     are details on joining, and starting, each type of game.
     Parallax Online
     ---------------
     Parallax Online ("PXO") is a free matching service with a lobby and
     chat rooms. You'll be able to chat with other Descent 3 players
     worldwide, and play against them. This service is free, for no
     additional matching or connect time charges.
     Before you choose a PXO game in Descent 3, you must first register
     on
     PXO to get a user name and password. To do this, just click the
     "PXO" button on the Descent 3 Launcher, or visit
     http://www.parallaxonline.com to register. Once your account is
     validated, which should take just a few minutes, you'll be able to
     play a game of Descent 3 over PXO.
     The login name you enter when registering for PXO is only used to
     connect to the service -- no one else will ever see it. On PXO
     you'll be identified to other players by the Pilot name you set in
     Descent 3. When you register, you're given the option of allowing
     other players to see your real name and email address, or you can
     choose to be totally anonymous.
     Parallax Online Details
     -----------------------
     After you select Parallax Online, the "Login to PXO" window
     appears. Type in your PXO login name and password as given to
     you when you registered (see above). After a few seconds,
     you'll enter the PXO screen. (If you get to the login window
     and haven't yet registered with PXO, click on "Create New
     Profile" to go to the PXO registration page.)
     To chat before you begin a game, double-click the name of one of
     the chat rooms at the top of the PXO window. A dialog box will
     appear letting you know what chat room you're in.
     To type something that everyone in the chat room can view, just
     type something and hit Enter. To send a private message to
     another pilot, click "Send Private Message", then type the
     message and pilot name in the dialog box that appears. You can
     find a pilot if you know his name by clicking "Find Pilot" and
     typing his or her name in the dialog box that appears. (This
     option will only find pilots in PXO Chat, not pilots who are in
     the middle of a PXO game.)
     After entering a chat room, you can get any pilot's stats by
     clicking on his name in the leftmost column then clicking "Get
     Pilot Info".
     When you're ready to start or join a game, click "Go To Games"
     and start or join a game as detailed below.
     In addition to the Chat and Game Matching services, PXO also gathers
     statistics from games played, including kills and deaths for each
     player. Visit the PXO web page at http://www.parallaxonline.com/ to
     view your stats, see the latest rankings, or see a list of games
     currently being played.
     A note about firewalls and proxies: You can't host a PXO game from
     behind a firewall. You can join a PXO game just fine, as long as the
     appropriate ports are up. See "Firewalls and Proxies", below.
     DirectPlay Modem
     ----------------
     This option lets you use your modem to directly play against another
     player. Note that this is not for Internet games when you use your
     modem to dial an ISP (Internet Service Provider) -- it's to let you
     directly call a friend over the modem to play. You need DirectX 6 to
     play a direct modem game, so Windows NT users can't use this option.
     Before you try to play Descent 3 over a direct modem connection, you
     must configure your modem through Windows. You can do this with the
     "Modem" option in the Windows Control Panel.
     After you choose a Direct Modem game, a screen appears letting you
     choose your modem, in case you have more than one. Click on your
     modem.
     If you want to host a game -- that is, your modem will be set to
     answer the phone when a friend calls -- click "Answer/Host Game",
     and
     see "Starting A New Game", below.
     If you want to join a game -- that is, your computer will call a
     friend who has already chosen to host a game -- type the phone
     number
     and click "Dial".
     Troubleshooting: DirectX 6 is required for direct modem games; we
     use DirectPlay for modem games. If the error "Unable to connect."
     appears when looking for games, or you get other communication
     problems, you should quit the Descent 3 demo on both machines and
     make sure they can talk to each other in the first place. To do
     this, run a terminal program like HyperTerminal on both machines --
     Windows 95 and 98 include HyperTerminal in the Start menu, under
     Programs-&gt;Accessories. Configure HyperTerminal on both machines
     to
     use the same settings, have one computer call the other, and type to
     each other in the window that appears. If you don't see the text
     that each other person is typing, you aren't set up correctly. Make
     sure you have selected the correct modem in the "Modem" Control
     Panel, with all the correct settings, including baud rate and COM
     port.
     DirectPlay Serial
     -----------------
     This option lets you play a two-player game in which both computers
     are connected directly to each other via a null-modem cable attached
     to each computer's serial port. You need DirectX 6 to play a direct
     serial game, so Windows NT users can't use this option.
     After you choose a Direct Serial game, a screen appears letting you
     set up your COM port. The default settings are COM1, 38400 baud, 1
     stop bit, no parity, and RTS/DTR flow control. Make sure both
     computers are set to the same settings on this screen, and then set
     the COM port to whichever COM port you have plugged the null modem
     cable into on each computer. Then one player should click "Start A
     New Game" and begin a new game as detailed in "Starting A
     Multiplayer
     Game", below. THEN, after that player is already in the game and
     flying around, the second player should click "Look For Games" and
     connect on the following screen.
     If the game plays slowly, try increasing the baud speed on both
     computers. We chose 38400 baud as a default speed to accommodate
     slower computers. You can increase the baud speed and you'll
     probably
     get faster game play. Make sure you set the baud speed to the same
     number on both computers.
     Troubleshooting: DirectX 6 is required for direct serial games; we
     use DirectPlay for serial games. If the error "Unable to connect."
     appears when looking for games, you should quit the Descent 3 demo
     on
     both machines and make sure they can talk to each other. To do this,
     run a terminal program like HyperTerminal on both machines --
     Windows
     95 and 98 include HyperTerminal in the Start menu, under
     Programs-&gt;Accessories. Configure HyperTerminal on both machines
     to
     use the same settings, and type in the window that appears. If you
     don't see the text that each other person is typing, you aren't set
     up correctly. Make sure you have selected the correct COM port, and
     make sure you are using a null-modem cable and not a
     straight-through
     serial cable. (There are also null-modem adapters you can attach to
     a straight-through serial cable.)
     IPX
     ---
     This option lets you join or start a game using the IPX network
     protocol to play over a LAN. After choosing this option, you can
     join an IPX game in progress by simply clicking the name of the
     game,
     then clicking "Join Selected". To start a game, click "Start A New
     Game", then see "Starting A New Game", below.
     Troubleshooting: Run NETTEST.EXE if you experience problems with IPX
     games. It may be able to detect certain problems with your network
     configuration. Beyond that, it's beyond the scope of a game readme
     file to attempt to troubleshoot an IPX network. Try using Windows'
     Network Control Panel, and take it from there.
     Direct TCP/IP
     -------------
     This option lets you join or start a game using the TCP/IP network
     protocol to play over a LAN, or over the Internet. To join a game on
     your local LAN, just choose this option, click the name of the game
     you want to join, and click "Join Selected".
     To join a game across the Internet via TCP/IP, first find out the IP
     address of the server. Click in the text box under the words "Search
     For Games At Address". Type in the IP address you wish to search
     (example: 127.0.0.127) and press Enter. If a game is available at
     that address, click the name of the game and click "Join Selected"
     to
     begin.
     To start a TCP/IP game, click "Start A New Game", then see "Starting
     A
     New Game", below.
     Troubleshooting: Run NETTEST.EXE if you experience problems with
     TCP/IP games. It may be able to detect certain problems with your
     network configuration. Again, it's unfortunately beyond the scope of
     a game readme file to attempt to troubleshoot a TCP/IP network. Try
     using Windows' Network Control Panel, and take it from there.

     3. STARTING (HOSTING) A NEW GAME
     ____________________________________
     Once you've chosen one of the preceding network options and clicked
     "Start A New Game", Descent 3 presents you with a screen listing
     your
     multiplayer options.
     Mission Name:
     Lets you choose the level to play. Choose "The Core"
     for a multiplayer level designed for 2-4 players. Choose
     "Polaris" for a multiplayer level designed for 4 players and up.
     Game Name:
     The name that will appear when other players attempt to join
     your game.
     Game Type:
     The demo version supports Anarchy and Capture-The-Flag. Anarchy
     is a big free-for-all: Everybody against everybody. In
     Capture-The-Flag, all players are assigned to either the Red
     Team or the Blue Team, and the goal is to find the other color's
     base, grab their flag by flying through it, fly back to your
     base, and drop off the enemy flag at your base. Your flag must
     also be at your base, so if someone on the enemy team already
     grabbed your flag, you must find him, blow him up, and return
     your own flag to your own base before you can score points for
     capturing the enemy flag.
     Multiplayer Options: Another screen appears with multiplayer
     options:
     Time Limit: The level automatically ends after this many
     minutes.
     Kill Goal: The level automatically ends after a player
     achieves this many kills.
     Max. Players: The maximum number of players that will be
     allowed into the game. We recommend 8 or
     fewer for the demo.
     Packets per second: The number of position update packets that
     all the computers in your game will send per
     second. (Technically, you also send packets
     when you fire a weapon.) In most cases, just
     5 packets per second is a good setting. You
     can set this number lower to allow more
     people in the game, and with less bandwidth
     requirements. Note that it's usually not a
     good idea to increase this number, because
     this will just result in a flood of
     superfluous data being transmitted over the
     network, and your game lag will probably
     increase.
     Respawn rate: Amount of time before a fixed powerup
     reappears.
     Client-server: You can choose either client-server or
     peer-to-peer. Client-server is best when the
     server has a fast connection. This option
     lets the most people join the game with
     lesser bandwidth requirements for each
     client. If you ever have problems with games
     becoming extremely lagged after playing for a
     while, try playing with a dedicated server
     (see below), or play peer-to-peer.
     Peer-peer: You can choose either client-server or peer-
     to-peer. Peer-to-peer is good for games
     when all the clients and the server have the
     same amount of bandwidth. In peer-to-peer,
     all clients will see player updates more
     quickly, but they will all need more
     bandwidth. In general, we predict peer-to-
     peer may be better for fewer people, but
     maybe not.
     Use rotational
     velocity: Produces smoother enemy ship movement, but
     requires a little more bandwidth.
     Drop out of order
     packets: Prevents out-of-order packets from causing a
     ship to ever appear to move backwards or pop
     around, but requires a little more bandwidth.
     Configure allowed
     ships/items: Displays a screen on which you can change
     what items are allowed and disallowed in
     your game. If you want to play a game in
     which the Vauss Cannon isn't allowed, this
     is how.
     Save Settings: Saves all the above settings in a file. If
     you always start games with the same
     multiplayer options, save them with this
     option.
     Load Settings: Load multiplayer settings which you
     previously saved with the "Save Settings"
     option.
     Start Game: Launch!
     ____________________________________
     4. ON-SCREEN F6 MULTIPLAYER MENU
     ____________________________________
     Press F6 while playing to display the on-screen multiplayer menu.
     While displaying this menu, use the following keys:
     Up Arrow: Move up to highlight the previous menu item
     Down Arrow: Move down to highlight the next menu item
     Right Arrow: Enter a submenu
     Left Arrow: Leave a submenu to enter the menu to the left
     Enter Key: Activate highlighted option in menu
     ESC Key or F6: Hide the on-screen menu
     Description of items in On-Screen menu
     --------------------------------------
     1) Server Commands Menu (only displayed on the server)
     This menu contains various options and commands that only the
     server can issue. This menu contains the following submenus:
     A) Kick
     This command will kick a player from the game. When you
     highlight this submenu you will get a list of all the players
     currently in the game. The number that is between the
     brackets ([]) is the player number of the player. To kick a
     player from the game, highlight their pilot name and activate
     (press Enter key).
     B) Ban
     This command will kick and ban a player from the game. This
     ban will only last as long as the server is up. When you
     highlight this submenu you will get a list of all the players
     currently in the game. The number that is between the
     brackets ([]) is the player number of the player. To ban a
     player from the game, highlight their pilot name and
     activate (press Enter key).
     C) End Level
     This command will end the level that is currently playing,
     and will send the game to the post-level results screen. To
     end the level, highlight this submenu and activate (press
     Enter key).
     D) Max HUD Name Level
     This command determines whether players will be able to
     display the pilot names of the other players on their HUD.
     There are three options:
     None - If this is set, the players will not be able to
     display any names on their HUD.
     Team Only - If playing a team game, players will be able
     to display the names of their teammates, but
     not of their opponents. In a non-team game,
     this option is the same as None.
     Full - Players will be ale to display the names of all
     players.
     E) Team Control (only available in team games)
     This submenu contains submenus with commands to change
     options for team games.
     1.) Balance Teams
     This command will automatically balance the number of
     players on the teams to make the teams fair. It balances
     based on seniority. Those that haven't been in the game
     as long as another player on their team will be have a
     greater chance of being forced to another team. To
     automatically balance the teams, select this option and
     activate (press Enter key).
     2.) AutoTeam Balance
     This command turns on/off the automatic placement of a
     new player to a game to the team with the least number
     of players. If this option is turned off then the
     player must either change his team to the team he wants
     to be on, or the server must force change him to a team.
     To turn on/off this option select On or Off from the sub
     menu of "AutoTeam Balance" and activate (press Enter
     key). The item with the arrow pointing at it is the
     current state of the option.
     3.) Allow Team Changing
     This command enables/disables allow players to change
     teams. If this option is off than the teams are
     essentially locked (until this option is turned on). To
     turn this option on or off, select On or Off from the sub
     menu of "Allow Team Changing" and activate (press Enter
     key). The item with the arrow pointing at it is the
     current state of the option.
     2) Observer Mode Menu
     This menu contains the commands to enter/exit observer mode to
     watch the game as a spectator. There are two different kinds of
     observer mode, roaming and piggyback. Roaming Observer mode
     lets you fly around freely. In piggyback mode you must select
     the player you want to observe, after doing so you will watch
     the game through their eyes.
     A) Observer Mode
     In this submenu you can turn on roaming observer mode, or turn
     off observer mode completely. To turn on/off this option select
     On or Off from the sub menu of "Observer Mode" and activate
     (press Enter key). The item with the arrow pointing at it is
     the current state of the option.
     B) PiggyBack Observer
     In this submenu you can select what player you would like to
     observe through the piggyback observer mode. Selecting this
     menu will give you a list of players currently in the game. To
     start piggybacking a player, highlight their pilot name and
     activate (press Enter key). If you select yourself, it will end
     the observer mode session.
     3) OnScreen Background
     In this menu you can enable or disable the backdrop of the
     On-Screen menu. To turn on/off this option select On or Off from
     the sub menu of "Background" and activate (press Enter key). The
     item with the arrow pointing at it is the current state of the
     option.
     4) Max HUD Name Level
     This command determines whether player names are visible on your
     HUD. Note that these settings are subject to the limitations
     set by the server; see "Max HUD Name Level" above. There are
     three options:
     None - If this is set, no names will appear on the HUD.
     Team Only - If playing a team game, the names of the player's
     teammates will appear on the HUD, but the names of

     This is more of a request to change teams, as the server can
     deny the request if the option to allow team changing is
     disabled (or the multiplayer game will not allow it, for
     instance, in a CTF game, if you have a flag and try to change
     teams, the request will be denied).

     5. MULTIPLAYER CONTROL COMMANDS
     ____________________________________
     Here is a list of commands you can give to the Descent 3 demo --
     both
     to your copy of the game and to the server -- while playing a
     multiplayer game, or while running a dedicated server. To enter a
     command, press the F8 key, then type the command and press Enter.
     For
     example, to show player info for player 0, you would press F8, then
     type:
     $playerinfo 0
     then press return. Many of these commands are available from the F6
     multiplayer menu that's available while playing the game. If you run
     a dedicated server, you'll need to type in these commands, since the
     multiplayer menu will be unavailable.
     Command List
     ------------
     $team &lt;Team_name&gt;
     From a client, changes your team. Team_name is the name of the
     team you want to change to.

     $serverhudnames none : Users can set $hudnames to 'none'.
     ____________________________
     6. FIREWALLS AND PROXIES
     ____________________________
     You can play a Descent 3 Demo net game over the Internet from behind
     a firewall or proxy, if you can talk your network administrators
     into
     opening the following ports:
     UDP 6493
     UDP 6440
     UDP 6200
     UDP 6201
     TCP 7070
     If you experience problems, run the NETTEST.EXE program that's
     included in the Descent 3 Demo directory. It will verify that your
     network and firewall configuration is operational, and will give you
     specific reasons for any failures that it finds. You can get help by
     launching the program by typing NETTEST.EXE --HELP for some
     information on its use.
     You can join PXO games from behind a firewall, but you can't host
     them. Someone who isn't behind a firewall will have to host the
     game.
     _________________________________
     7. RUNNING A DEDICATED SERVER
     _________________________________
     If you are lucky enough to have a spare computer on your network
     that
     nobody uses, put it to good work! Set it up as a Descent 3 dedicated
     server. This may help the speed of network games for all clients.
     To start a dedicated server, install the Descent 3 Demo on the
     machine, and in the Misc. tab in setup, type:
     -dedicated example.cfg
     where "example.cfg" is the name of the dedicated server
     configuration
     file. This is a file you can configure yourself with various
     commands. The commands are:
     PPS &lt;num&gt; - Sets the packets per second that the server sends
     out.
     Timelimit &lt;num&gt; -How long (in minutes) each level lasts
     Killgoal &lt;num&gt; - End the level after this many kills
     RepsawnTime &lt;num&gt; - How long (in seconds) it takes powerups to
     respawn
     Gamename &lt;string&gt; - The name of the game
     MissionName &lt;string&gt; - The mission you're playing
     ScriptName &lt;string&gt; the name of the netgame you want
     ConnectionName &lt;string&gt; the name of the connection you want
     MaxPlayers &lt;num&gt; - The max numbers of players in the game
     In addition, you can type:
     Quit
     Endlevel
     while the game is running to quit the game or end the level,
     respectively.
     NOTE: The first line of the server config file must read:
     [server config file]
     A sample dedicated server .cfg file might look like this:
     ----------------------------------
     [server config file]
     PPS=8
     TimeLimit=10
     KillGoal=0
     RespawnTime=60
     GameName=Dedicated Server!
     MissionName=Polaris.d3l
     Scriptname=Anarchy
     ConnectionName=Direct TCP~IP
     ----------------------------------
     There is an example server config file included with the demo.
     Its filename is "dedicated.cfg" and it can be found in the same
     directory as the demo.
     END OF MULTIPLAYER README FILE. HAVE FUN.
     There you go
