   First Patient Treatment with the CyberKnife® M6™ System and the InCise™
   Multileaf Collimator Has Been Completed CNW Group Tuesday, March 3,
   2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   Patient with Brain Tumor Received Extremely Precise Treatment in
   Reduced Time
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. , March 3, 2015 /CNW/ -- Accuray Incorporated
   ([3]ARAY) announced today that the first patient treatment has been
   completed using the CyberKnife® M6™ System with the InCise™ Multileaf
   Collimator (MLC). The treatment was administered as a multidisciplinary
   effort between Dr. Steven Burton from the Department of Radiation
   Oncology and Dr. Johnathan Engh from the Department of Neurosurgery at
   UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . UPMC was one of the InCise MLC
   evaluation sites working in collaboration with Accuray.
   "We have successfully treated the first patient using the CyberKnife M6
   System with the InCise MLC. The patient, diagnosed with a brain
   meningioma, was a typical candidate for highly-focused treatment that
   can be delivered by the CyberKnife," said Dr. Dwight E. Heron MD,
   FACRO, FACR, Director of Radiation Services. "With the addition of the
   MLC, we were able to achieve equivalent precision in tumor targeting
   and sparing of healthy tissue, but it took us less than half the time –
   just under 22 minutes – to complete a traditional one hour treatment.
   The treatment time includes continuous imaging throughout the procedure
   to ensure accurate dose delivery and the actual time spent delivering
   the radiation. This real-world case is consistent with our InCise MLC
   technical evaluation experience and exceeded our expectations in its
   efficiency."
   The M6 Series delivers radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation
   therapy, enabling precise, high-quality dose distributions to be
   confidently administered to the patient with extreme accuracy over a
   minimum number of treatments, reducing side effects and preserving
   patients' quality of life. The system is able to adjust and
   automatically stay on target in real-time, accounting for patient and
   tumor motion. CyberKnife is the only robotic radiosurgery system
   available today which delivers such high precision treatments for
   intra- and extra-cranial disease sites throughout the body.
   "We congratulate Dr. Heron, Dr. Huq and their team on treating the
   first patient using the CyberKnife M6 System and InCise MLC," said
   Joshua H. Levine , president and chief executive officer of Accuray.
   "With the addition of the MLC, clinicians can deliver the same precise
   radiosurgery treatments they have come to expect with the CyberKnife
   System, while significantly reducing treatment times, for a wider range
   of tumor types, including larger and different kinds of tumors than
   were previously treated."
