Why Calorie Counts are Wrong: 6 Diet Myths, Busted

   nutrition-label-calories

   When I tell clients that they can lose weight by eating more calories,
   they often look at me like I’m either trying to trick them or I’ve lost
   my marbles.

   But the truth is, the concept of “calories in versus calories out” is
   greatly oversimplified, and in my opinion, seriously outdated.

   When I hear people repeat notions like “a calorie is a calorie” I like
   to reply: “That’s like saying a cubic zirconia is the same as a
   sparkling diamond.”

   Here’s why, plus five more common diet and weight-loss myths.

   Myth: Calories, not quality, impact weight
   A [99]University of Florida study found that people who consume more
   antioxidants maintain lower BMIs, smaller waistlines, and lower
   body-fat percentages than those with lower intakes, even though both
   groups consumed about the same number of daily calories–a strong
   indication that the nutrients calories are bundled with play a key role
   in metabolism. Other research has uncovered similar effects. Wake
   Forest University researchers found that even at the same calorie and
   fat levels, monkeys fed foods high in trans fat gained four times more
   weight and 30% more belly fat compared to animals who munched on meals
   made with natural plant-based fat. More evidence that eating 500
   calories worth of processed or fast food does not have the same impact
   on the body as eating a 500-calorie meal composed of fruits, veggies,
   whole grain, lean protein, and heart healthy fat (cubic zirconia versus
   diamond).

   Myth: The math is precise
   This week, a [100]Harvard professor created a buzz when she spoke out
   about the shortcomings of the 100+ year old formula used to determine
   the calorie values many people rely upon. Turns out, based on further
   study, several foods actually contain less, because some components
   don’t get digested. Incomplete digestion means that rather than being
   absorbed into the body, where calories have to be burned, used, or
   stored, some simply travel through your digestive system, to become
   excreted as waste. This type of analysis led to the recent insight that
   [101]almonds supply about 30% fewer calories than the label states,
   while other foods may pack more than expected. In addition, many
   studies have shown that after ingestion, some foods, [102]like ginger
   and [103]chili pepper, or food patterns, like [104]vegan diets,
   increase metabolic rate, triggering you to burn more calories. In
   short, 2 + 2 may equal 6–or 3!
   Myth: Numbers don’t lie
   Don’t shoot the messenger, but by law, most products are allowed a 20%
   variance when it comes to the accuracy of the calories stated on the
   label. So if a frozen dinner lists 300 calories, it could actually
   contain over 350. If you eat several packaged foods each day, and
   you’re a calorie counter, you may wind up with a few hundred more than
   you budgeted for. And that’s for sanctioned “wiggle room.” A recent
   [105]Today Show investigation found that the numbers on diet frozen
   treats were off by as much as 68%.
   Myth: Counting calories is a surefire strategy
   Can you count calories and still gain weight? Maybe. In a recent
   [106]study from the University of California, San Francisco, scientists
   randomly assigned 121 women to one of four protocols. The first tracked
   their calories, keeping them to 1,200 a day. The second ate normally,
   but recorded the number of calories they consumed. The third ate 1,200
   calories a day, but didn’t have to record them, and the fourth ate
   normally, without any calorie tracking. Researchers found that when
   calories were limited, levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, rose. And
   calorie counting, even without limitations, also made the women more
   stressed. Cortisol is known to rev up appetite, spike cravings for
   fatty and sugary foods, and lead to an increase in belly fat, so
   causing it to surge surely isn’t a smart weight-control strategy.

   Myth: All calories are created equal
   There are three types of calories your body needs: Carbohydrates,
   protein, and fat. Because each performs a unique function, they aren’t
   interchangeable, so getting the right amount of each is important. For
   example, if you ate too few protein calories and too many carb
   calories, the jobs that proteins do wouldn’t get done, and the surplus
   carb calories would get sent straight to your fat cells. This can
   result in weight gain, as well as the loss of muscle mass, dry, dull
   hair and skin, hormonal imbalances, and a weaker immune system. Too
   much or too little of all three calorie types can lead to unwanted side
   effects, so getting a certain number of daily calories, without regard
   to the type of food, just doesn’t make sense.

   Myth: Counting calories is necessary
   In one recent survey, only 12% of adults were able to accurately
   estimate the number of daily calories they need for their age, height,
   weight, and physical activity level. If you’ve overestimated your
   calorie needs, which I’ve seen many clients do, counting won’t create
   results. Or if the quality, balance, or even timing of your calories is
   off kilter, counting may also be futile. For these reasons and the
   others above, I’ve seen clients start to eat more calories and finally
   break a weight loss plateau, and achieve real and lasting results. I’m
   not saying to ignore calories completely, but don’t obsess over them.
   Instead, choose more fresh foods, or foods as close to their natural
   state as possible; strive for a balance of “good” carbs, lean protein
   and healthy fats to help your body function optimally; eat breakfast
   every day to [107]jump-start your metabolism, eat on a regular
   schedule, spacing your meals about 3-5 hours apart; pay attention as
   you eat and stop when you feel just full enough, satisfied, energized,
   and ready to move on with your day. When you listen, your body is
   pretty good at telling you how much it needs, no math required.
