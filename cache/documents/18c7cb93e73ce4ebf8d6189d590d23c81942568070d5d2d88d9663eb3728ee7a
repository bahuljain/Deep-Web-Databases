   You Can Keep Your Doctor -- And Your Health Plan U.S.News & World
   Report LP Monday, April 21, 2014
   Dr. Michael F. Roizen
   You need to read this so you protect you. Every other blog in this
   series is about an important change you can make to keep the actual age
   of your body, [2]your RealAge, younger. And every now and then the
   choice of blog topics is influenced by events you can't control, but
   that affect you in a major way. I write about how you can stay young in
   face of these changes. Today, that focuses on the changes in the
   healthcare system that are and would occur due to cost pressures and
   transparency so big that even President Obama and the ACAPPA (aka
   Obamacare) can't make it easy for you.
   That's why his phrases: "If you like your doctor, you can keep your
   doctor; If you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan!"
   have proven to be false for so many. Even in the most powerful
   executive office in the U.S., Obama couldn't ensure that. But the
   errors in his statements simply reflect that the changes American
   medicine is undergoing are bigger than Obamacare -- and were occurring
   without Obamacare. Yes. Obamacare is shaping them, and maybe
   accelerating them, but these changes alter what you need to do to get
   care.
   [Read: [3]How Wellness Is Pushing the U.S. to Prosperity .]
   Let's look at this from how the most major payers of healthcare costs
   are responding -- the insurance companies and the U.S. government
   (through Medicare, Medicaid and payment for insurance for government
   employees) is responding. How is that changing your doctors' and
   hospitals' income statements? And then, what can you as an individual
   do for you and yours until these changes shake out? While finances
   often seem boring, it's probably causing your local hospital trustees'
   blood to boil, and we'll try to make it that exciting for you, too.
   Hospitals are seeing lower reimbursements now due to declining
   admissions -- and greater transparency and lower payment rates. I'll
   take the hypothetical example of a for-profit system, although the
   exact same logic goes in spades for a not-for profit academic system.
   This hypothetical but realistic hospital system currently bills about
   $3 billion for medical services and collects around $1 billion. That's
   right -- the institution, through insurance contracts and payment of
   fractions of bills by the government, gets 33 cents for every dollar it
   bills. It costs such a system around $900 million to provide all the
   services, and thus they are able to have a profit and invest $100
   million in plant and equipment maintenance, as well as new equipment at
   their facilities. And this hospital system was exceptional, as many
   community hospitals function on margins below this 10 percent figure --
   like 5 percent.
   A system like this one gets this revenue by collecting about $0.23 on
   the dollar billed from Medicare; about $0.18 on the dollar billed from
   Medicaid; and about $0.38 on the dollar billed for the aggregate of
   commercially insured patients. We are sure this seems bizarre to
   someone from outside the U.S., and actually it does to us, too, but
   it's the way the system has evolved.
   [Read: [4]How You Can and Should Protect Yourself From Health Care
   Reform .]
   But now, insurance exchanges are helping more people chose policies
   that pay Medicaid rates -- nearer 18 cents for each dollar billed --
   and it isn't just the uninsured that are choosing these policies, but
   those who work for small companies that do not cover health insurance
   for their employees. Eight million people have chosen these policies so
   far. That is increasing outpatient demand and reducing reimbursements
   -- going from a policy that paid 38 cents to one that pays 18 cents per
   dollar billed seems (from what I can learn from friends) to be hitting
   many hospitals and even academic health systems hard. That's right,
   being paid 20 cents less on each dollar billed on just 20 percent of
   the 3 billion you bill reduces our hospital system's income from 1
   billion to 880 million, or a net loss of 20 million versus a profit of
   100 million (remember it cost 900 million to provide the care the
   hospital provided). What would you do if you ran that hospital system?
   You'd cut every non-essential service you could, and darn fast. Your
   grass would get cut less often. And those decreases mean less money for
   everyone selling services to that hospital -- but let's leave that for
   another blog.
   Now couple that with reference pricing: An article in Health Affairs
   indicates that in California, the CALPERS system -- the largest
   state-run health insurance provider -- has gone to reference pricing in
   some areas. CALPERS gives employees $30,000 for a total hip or total
   knee replacement and lists the hospitals that charge less than that.
   Virtually all academic medical centers (those that provide care for the
   sickest, and those that train our future doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
   dieticians, etc.) fall into the high-cost group, and their share of the
   CALPERS patient population that has hip or knee replacements went from
   54 to 35 percent, while the share for low-cost hospitals has climbed
   from 46 to 65 percent in less than two years. (Only one high-priced
   group hospital in California converted to a low-cost group hospital in
   the past three years. These trends have accelerated since 2012, we are
   told.)

   Many other states will soon adopt reference pricing, where you'll be
   guided to hospitals that charge less for a service (and maybe try to
   not take patients with conditions that increase cost). This means there
   will be less dollars for the hospitals that have taken the sickest
   patients to continue to do so in transfer from the lower priced
   hospitals, as well as less dollars to train doctors. And doctors are
   seeing less revenue as more of their patients are paid for at or near
   the Medicaid rate of 18 cents per dollar billed, versus the private or
   even Medicare rates of 38 and 23 cents on the dollar billed. So it's
   not just the for-profit hospitals that are seeing less revenue, but all
   health providers.
   How long will the pain last for the hospitals and health service
   providers till we remodel the system so all practitioners practice at
   the limit of their license and only the sickest get nursing or
   physician care? We don't know how this will settle out. This change was
   tried twice in the U.S. and once in several Canadian provinces in my
   job lifetime, but each time political pressure -- "I want a great
   neurosurgeon when I want one, not when my back pain has lasted 10
   weeks" -- forced reversion to something close to the prior system. But
   this time seems different. And for you to avoid a shortage of providers
   or find out that your doctor has dropped out of accepting your specific
   insurance here are four tips:
   No.1: Hug your doctor and your doctor's office manager, and do whatever
   you need to make sure your doctor is willing to make an exception for
   you and yours to be covered by her -- even if she takes no one else
   from that network.
   No. 2: Hug your company HR director and CEO, and hope they provide
   insurance coverage and a plan that allows you to keep your doctor. It
   isn't the ACA or Obamacare that changed this; it is your company or
   their insurance plan. Also hope that they'll include the academic
   center nearest you -- in case you or yours need complex care. And tell
   these folks how much your company's health insurance plan means to you
   and your productivity.
   No. 3: Get preventive care now. Do whatever you can to avoid toxins
   such as tobacco, secondhand smoke and the five food felons, and learn
   to love physical activity and manage stress.
   No. 4: Take your do-over, and stay as well as you can for three to five
   years until this all shakes out.
