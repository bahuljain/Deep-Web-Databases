       Before dual and quad core processors, they made dual chip boards.
       They were short lived and generated a massive amount of heat. If
       your looking to get more horse power out of your rig, gonna have to
       replace the MB with one that supports core2 processors.

       i guess no because its must be a built-in to the motherboard but
       there are computers which have dual-cores or two cpus inside, for
       faster execution
