     In Brief

     People with diabetes are frequently given advice about protein that has
     no scientific basis. In addition, although weight is lost when
     individuals follow a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, there is no
     evidence that such diets are followed long-term or that there is less
     recidivism than with other low-calorie diets. People with type 1 or
     type 2 diabetes who are in poor metabolic control may have increased
     protein requirements. However, the usual amount of protein consumed by
     people with diabetes adequately compensates for the increased protein
     catabolism. People with diabetes need adequate and accurate information
     about protein on which to base their food decisions.

   In the United States, ~16% of the average adult consumption of calories
   is from protein, and this has varied little from 1909 to the present.^1
   Protein intake is also fairly consistent across all ages from infancy
   to older age.

   A daily intake of 2,500 calories contributes ~100 g of proteinabout
   twice what is needed to replace protein lost on a daily basis. Excess
   amino acids must be converted into other storage products or oxidized
   as fuel. Therefore, in theory, the excess ingested protein could,
   through the process of gluconeogenesis, produce glucose. This would
   mean that 100 g of protein could produce ~50 g of glucose. This has
   been the basis of the statement that if about half of ingested protein
   is converted to glucose, protein will have one-half the effect of
   carbohydrate on blood glucose levels. However, this belief has been
   challenged.^2-4

   Protein controversies exist either because research has not provided
   conclusive answers or because professionals are not aware of the
   research. This article will review available research on common advice
   given to people with diabetes in regard to protein, the high-protein
   and low-carbohydrate diets, and protein requirements for people with
   type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.

   Common Advice for Protein Given to Patients with Diabetes
   The following statements are not based on scientific evidence yet are
   often given as advice to people with diabetes.
     * "Proteins" are foods like meat, cheese, and peanut butter.
     * Between 5060% of protein becomes glucose and enters the
       bloodstream about 34 hours after it's eaten.
     * Don't eat fruit, fruit juice, or a "sweet" (often called
       fast-acting carbohydrates) for a snack without also eating protein.
       The protein will slow the absorption of carbohydrate.
     * Bedtime snacks should always contain protein. The protein will be
       converted to blood glucose more slowly than carbohydrates and will
       keep blood glucose levels from dropping too low during the night.
     * Treat an insulin reaction with a fast-acting carbohydrate and add
       protein to provide a later source of blood glucose. This will
       prevent the blood glucose from dropping too low again.
     * Eating too much protein can damage the kidneys.

   This article will show how these statements are often misleading and
   what limited evidence is available regarding these recommendations.

   What are "protein" foods?
   Food choices that many patients make when given advice to eat protein
   are usually a meat or a meat substitute, such as cheese or peanut
   butter. Some may also think of milk as a protein. Health professionals
   often call these foods "protein." But are they really protein?
   Certainly, they all contain protein. But most foods that contain
   protein also contain fat, and a few also contain carbohydrate. As
   illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, very few foods are only protein. Perhaps
   health professionals should call these foods "meat or meat substitutes"
   or "protein plus fat" instead of "protein."

   Does 5060% of protein become glucose and enter the bloodstream in 34
   hours?
   Gannon and Nuttall^4 report that in 1915, Janney calculated that ~3.5 g
   glucose could be produced for every gram of nitrogen excreted in the
   urine as the result of a beef protein meal. Beef protein is 16%
   nitrogen; thus, 1 g of nitrogen is excreted for every 6.25 g protein.
   Theoretically, then, 56% of ingested beef protein, by weight, can be
   converted to glucose. However, this was only a theoretical calculation.
   Gannon and Nuttall point out that, shortly after that calculation was
   reported, a number of researchers showed that the ingestion of protein
   by subjects with and without diabetes did not result in an increase in
   blood glucose levels.


            Table 2. Protein and Fat in Meat and Meat Substitutes

     Calories from protein Calories from fat

   Nuts (almonds), 1 oz 22 131
   Peanut butter, 2 Tbsp 32 144
   Hot dog, 1 28 147

   As an example, as early as 1936, Conn and Newburgh^5 reported no effect
   on blood glucose levels after a meal containing a large amount of
   protein in the form of lean beef. Fifteen subjects with diabetes and
   three control subjects were fed breakfasts of glucose or carbohydrate
   or protein foods calculated to yield equal amounts of glucose (2 g
   protein/kg compared to 1 g carbohydrate/kg). The blood glucose response
   after carbohydrate or glucose was as expected. However, there was no
   increase in blood glucose levels after the protein meal even though
   there was a consistent rise in blood urea nitrogen indicating protein
   utilization. The finding that protein did not raise blood glucose
   levels seems to have been lost or misinterpreted over the years.

   More recently, data from Nuttall et al.^6-9 also indicate that
   peripheral glucose concentration does not increase after protein
   ingestion in subjects with and without diabetes.

   Nuttall et al.^10 gave nine subjects with mild type 2 diabetes 50 g
   protein, 50 g glucose, or 50 g protein and 50 g glucose and determined
   the plasma glucose and insulin responses over the next 5 hours. The
   glucose response to glucose was as expected, but the glucose response
   to protein remained stable for 2 hours and then began to decline. When
   protein and glucose were combined, the peak response was similar to
   that of glucose alone. However, during the late postprandial period,
   the glucose response was reduced by 34%. The insulin responses for
   protein and glucose were similar, but when combined the insulin
   response was nearly doubled. The glucose decrease when protein and
   glucose were combined was attributed to the increased insulin response
   to the combination. See Figure 1.

   Figure 1. Plasma glucose and serum insulin responses to ingestion of 50
   g glucose, 50 g protein, or a combinatino of 50 g glucose + 50 g
   protein. Reprinted with permission from reference 10.

   Gannon et al.^11 reported on the glucose appearance rate over 8 hours
   following the ingestion of 50 g protein in the form of very lean beef
   compared to water in subjects with type 2 diabetes. After water alone,
   the plasma glucose concentration decreased from 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl)
   to 5.4 mmol/l (98 mg/dl). After 50 g of protein, the glucose
   concentration at 1 hour increased by 0.1 mmol/L (3 mg/dl) and then
   decreased similarly to water. The ingested protein resulted in only ~2
   g glucose being produced and released into the circulation. The fate of
   the remaining absorbed amino acids is unknown. Plasma insulin changed
   little after water, but after protein there was a threefold increase in
   insulin and a 50% increase in plasma glucagon.

   This raises the question of why, if gluconeogenesis from protein
   occurs, does the glucose produced not appear in the general
   circulation? Several theories have been suggested. The first is that
   considerably less than the theoretical amount of glucose (5060%)
   produced from protein actually is produced and enters the general
   circulation, and the small amount of glucose released is matched by a
   corresponding increase in glucose use, if adequate insulin is
   available.^4 Another theory suggests that the process of
   gluconeogenesis from protein occurs during a 24-hour period, and the
   slowly and evenly produced glucose can be disposed of over a long
   period of time.^5 It is also speculated that the insulin stimulated by
   dietary protein causes the glucose formed to be rapidly stored as
   glycogen in the liver and in skeletal muscles. This glucose can then be
   released when insulin levels are low or glucagon levels are elevated,
   and the body does not identify if the glucose is from protein or
   carbohydrate.

   To understand this process of gluconeogenesis and the question of why
   protein does not affect blood glucose levels, it is helpful to briefly
   review the metabolism of dietary proteins. The majority of protein is
   digested, and the amino acids not used for gut fuel are metabolized in
   the intestinal mucosal cells and transported by the portal vein to the
   liver for protein synthesis or gluconeogenesis.^12 In the liver,
   nonessential amino acids are largely deaminated, and the amino group
   (nitrogen) removed is converted into urea for excretion in the
   urine.^13 It has been shown that in subjects without and with mild type
   2 diabetes, ~5070% of a 50-g protein meal is accounted for over an
   8-hour period by deamination in the liver and intestine and synthesis
   to urea.^14 It has been assumed that the remaining carbon skeletons
   from the nonessential amino acids are available for glucose synthesis,
   which would then enter into the general circulation.

   The essential amino acids pass through the liver into the general
   circulation, where they may be removed and used for new protein
   synthesis or, alternatively, for skeletal muscle fuel. Circulating
   amino acids stimulate insulin and glucagon secretion. The amino acids
   that stimulate glucagon are different from those that stimulate insulin
   secretion.^15-17

   To add to the confusion, the effect of protein on glucose appearance is
   influenced by insulin availability. With insulin deficiency, the
   oxidation of branched chain amino acids in muscle and uptake of alanine
   (the principle glycogenic amino acid) by the liver is accelerated,
   resulting in increased gluconeogenesis and augmented protein
   catabolism.^18 The accompanying rise in glucose levels is most likely
   due to an increased conversion of ingested protein into glucose and to
   a decreased glucose removal rate. In subjects with diabetes who had
   insulin withheld for 24 hours, there was a three- to fourfold increase
   in liver glucose output after protein ingestion.^19 However, in the
   presence of insulin, alanine uptake by the liver is virtually zero,^20
   and hepatic glucose production falls by 85%.^21 Indirectly then,
   insulin could reduce gluconeogenesis in the liver by decreasing the
   amino acid substrate supply. Insulin also inhibits the degradation of
   body proteins and lowers the circulating concentration of many amino
   acids.^22

   The net effect on glucose output by the liver depends on the ratio of
   insulin to glucagon. In people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the
   glucagon response to protein is considerably greater than in people
   without diabetes.^4 Glucagon stimulates an increase in hepatic glucose
   production due to an increase in glycogenolysis and an increase in
   gluconeogenesis. Glucagon antagonizes the effect of insulin in the
   liver. However, it does not antagonize the insulin-stimulated uptake of
   glucose in muscle or the insulin-mediated decrease in release of
   non-esterified fatty acids from fat cells.^4

   Therefore, the process of gluconeogenesis is affected by substrate
   supply and level of glycemic control. However, in people with
   well-controlled diabetes, minimal amounts of hepatic glucose are
   released into the general circulation after the ingestion of protein.

   Does protein slow the absorption of carbohydrate?
   In the study by Nuttall et al.,^10 when protein and glucose were
   combined, the peak response was similar to the peak response of glucose
   alone. That is, adding protein to carbohydrate did not slow the
   absorption or peak of the glucose response. (Figure 1).

   Incidentally, what is a "fast-acting" carbohydrate? Previously, it was
   assumed that fast-acting carbohydrates were sugars or juices. It is now
   known that this is not true, and if there were a fast-acting
   carbohydrate, it would probably be a starch.^23 "Fast-acting
   carbohydrate" is a term we need to eliminate from our diabetes
   vocabulary.

   The effect of adding protein (25 g) or adding fat (5 or 10 g) to
   breakfasts containing 60 g carbohydrate in 24 subjects with type 2
   diabetes was also studied by Nordt et al.^24 Glucose concentrations
   were similar after the three meals, but after the protein-enriched
   meal, the postprandial insulin and glucagon responses were
   significantly increased. Neither varying the ratio of fat to protein
   nor increasing the amount of fat affected postprandial glucose values.
   The late reduction in postprandial glucose observed by Nuttall et
   al.^10 with the addition of protein was not seen in this study. This
   may be due to the fact that in this study more normal amounts of
   protein were added.

   How adding large amounts of protein or fat to a standard lunch would
   affect postmeal glucose responses and insulin needs in subjects with
   type 1 diabetes was studied by Peters and Davidson.^25 In 12
   individuals who by the use of a biostator were euglycemic, a standard
   lunch (450 kcal) was compared to protein-added (200 kcal) or a
   fat-added (200 kcal) lunch. After the fat-added lunch (2 Tbsp
   margarine), the peak glucose response was delayed, but the total
   glucose response was unchanged. After the protein-added lunch (7 oz
   turkey), the early glucose response was similar to the standard lunch,
   but late glucose response (25 hours) was slightly increased, and the
   late insulin requirement was greater by 34 U. This late insulin
   requirement (25 hours) was statistically significant, although the
   total insulin requirement over the 5 hours was not.

   Adding protein did not delay the peak glucose response, but whether the
   addition of protein to a meal or snack prevents late-onset hypoglycemia
   cannot be answered by this study. The study ended at 5 hours, at which
   time glucose levels were similar after all three meals. (Figure 2.)

   Figure 2. Blood glucose response for a standard (STD) meal,
   protein-added (PRO) meal, and fat-added meal. Reprinted with permission
   from reference 25.

   Thus, the carbohydrate content of the meal is the main determinant of
   the peak glucose response.^26,27 Although this may vary depending on
   the glycemic response to the carbohydrate, it appears not to be
   affected by the protein content. Fat delays the peak but not the total
   glucose response.^25,28 However, patients often report that when they
   eat large amounts of certain foods, such as pizza, meat, or fat, their
   blood glucose responses are elevated even if they keep their
   carbohydrate consistent.^29,30 The reason remains a mystery, but this
   does mean that if patients have documented this response to certain
   foods, they will probably need to adjust their premeal short- or
   rapid-acting insulin or eat smaller servings of these foods.

   Is it important to have protein for a bedtime snack or before exercise?
   First, we should consider the logic of recommending the addition of 12
   oz. of protein to prevent hypoglycemia. Even if 50% of the protein were
   converted to glucose and entered into the circulation, this would only
   be a total of 3.57 g of glucose. It is unlikely that this amount of
   glucose would have much effect on increasing blood glucose levels. The
   mechanism would have to be due to protein's effect on glucagon (or on
   other counterregulatory hormones). However, the effects of glucagon are
   reported to be short-lived and transient.^31,32

   The recommendation to add 1 or 2 oz of protein to an evening snack to
   prevent late-onset hypoglycemia was studied by Hess and Beebe.^33 In 15
   well-controlled subjects with type 1 diabetes, two bedtime snacks, 30 g
   carbohydrate or 30 g carbohydrate plus 14 g protein, were consumed on
   three separate occasions, and blood glucose was compared at 1, 2, and 3
   hours postprandial and at fasting. Blood glucose values before the
   bedtime snack (132 vs. 120 mg/dl) and 1 hour and 2 hours after the
   snacks were similar, but blood glucose values at 3 hours postprandial
   and at fasting were significantly higher after the protein-containing
   snack (144 vs. 164 mg/dl 3 hours postprandial, and 112 vs. 143 mg/dl
   fasting, respectively).

   There were no significant differences in hypoglycemic incidents, so it
   is uncertain whether adding protein to a 30-g carbohydrate snack was
   necessary or whether it just added unneeded calories. However, if
   overnight hypoglycemia is a problem that cannot be corrected by insulin
   adjustments, rather than add extra carbohydrate to the bedtime snack,
   protein could be tried. Furthermore, if individuals were still hungry
   after the 30-g carbohydrate snack, adding extra protein might be better
   than adding extra carbohydrate.

   There is also no evidence to suggest that adding protein to a snack
   before (or after) exercise prevents hypoglycemia any better than just a
   carbohydrate snack. Nathan et al.^34 reported that in intensively
   treated individuals with type 1 diabetes, a 13-g carbohydrate snack
   before exercise of short duration (<45 min) was enough to prevent
   post-exercise hypoglycemia.

   Does adding protein to the treatment of hypoglycemia prevent late-onset
   hypoglycemia?
   In a small study (six subjects with type 1 diabetes), Gray et al.^35
   reported on the rate of restoration of euglycemia after treatment of
   hypoglycemia with either identical amounts of carbohydrate (15 g) or
   carbohydrate supplemented with protein (14 g) and the subsequent
   development of hypoglycemia. Subjects were given insulin by infusion
   until their glucose levels fell to 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) and were then
   treated. After both treatments, the insulin infusion was continued for
   the next 3 hours or until glucose again fell to 2.8 mmol/l. Glucose
   levels, time to peak glucose levels, and subsequent rate of glucose
   fall were similar after both treatments. Despite hypoglycemia, glucagon
   concentration did not increase in either group until food was ingested.
   At that point, there was a transient increase in glucagon in the group
   treated with carbohydrate plus protein with no effect on glucose levels
   (Figure 3.). The researchers concluded that adding protein to the
   treatment of hypoglycemia merely adds unneeded calories.

   at which PG levels first reached 50 mg/dl and subjects ingested either
   bread alone or bread plus meat. The test insulin infusion was continued
   for the next 3 h (0180 min) or until PG fell again to 50 mg/dl.

   Does eating a high-protein diet cause renal disease?
   Despite the widespread belief that protein ingestion can influence the
   development of renal disease, dietary intake of protein is reported to
   be similar in patients with or without nephropathy. Nyberg et al.^36
   investigated protein intake in three groups: 1) patients who had
   diabetes 30 years or more without nephropathy; 2) patients with
   nephropathy but stable glomerular filtration rates; and 3) patients
   with progressive nephropathy and declining glomerular filtration rates.
   In all three groups, average protein intake was >80 g/day (~1617% of
   daily calories), with no relationship between the amount of protein
   ingested and the progression of nephropathy.

   Watts et al.^37 investigated dietary protein in patients with type 1
   diabetes with and without microalbuminuria. Dietary protein intake was
   similar in both groups. Ekberg et al.^38 also found no support for a
   relationship between high protein intake and glomerular hyperfiltration
   in insulin-treated patients. In tobacco users with hyperfiltration, a
   positive relationship was found between urinary albumin excretion and
   protein intake, but this was not found in non-users of tobacco. Jameel
   et al.^39 reported on dietary protein intake and clinical proteinuria
   in patients with type 2 diabetes. Again, protein intake was simila,
   with no correlation between protein intake and clinical proteinuria. In
   all of the above studies, protein intake was in the range of usual
   dietary intake and rarely exceeded 20% of the calories.

   In a cross-sectional, clinic-based study (EURODIAB IDDM Complications
   Study) of more than 2,500 people with type 1 diabetes, individuals who
   reported protein consumption of <20% of total calories had average
   albumin excretion rates (AERs) below 20 mg/min. However, in those in
   whom protein intake was >20% (22% of patients), average AERs increased
   and were in the microalbuminuric range (>20 mg/min). Of the patients
   with macroalbuminuria, 32% consumed >20% of protein, while this
   percentage was 23% for the microalbuminuric and 20% for the
   normoalbuminuric individuals with type 1 diabetes. Trends reached
   statistical significance for total protein and animal protein, while no
   association was seen for vegetable protein. This trend was particularly
   pronounced in patients with hypertension and/or elevated HbA[1c
   ]values. These findings support the recommendation for people with
   diabetes not to consume protein intakes >20% of total calories.^40

   In an interesting study, excess microalbuminuria was related to
   saturated fat intake and not to protein. In a cross-sectional,
   population-based study of Tasmanian adults with type 1 diabetes with
   microalbuminuria, on at least two or three occasions, excess
   microalbuminuria was associated with relative high intakes of saturated
   fat and a decreased prevalence with relative high intakes of
   protein.^41

   High-Protein, Low-Carbohydrate Diets
   Weight loss and improved blood glucose control are claims being made
   for high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets. The advantages of the
   high-protein, low-carbohydrate approach are that diets that eliminate a
   whole category of nutrients, in this case carbohydrates, are lower in
   calories and so result in weight loss. With a high protein intake and
   strict limitation of carbohydrate, water stored with glycogen
   (carbohydrate) is released. This rapid loss of fluid is an initial boon
   to dieters looking for fast results. Unfortunately, it isn't stored fat
   that is being lost. Fasting ketosis, which results in loss of appetite,
   may also develop. Furthermore, few people can eat endless amounts of
   animal protein and fat for weeks on end, and so they eat less and less.
   The good news is that, with a high-protein diet, weight is lost,
   insulin needs drop, and blood glucose and sometimes even lipid levels
   often improve. It works, at least temporarily.

   Although the authors of the popular books all take a slightly different
   approach, the basic premises are fairly similar. Eating a
   high-carbohydrate diet makes people "fat" because carbohydrates
   increase blood glucose levels, causing a greater release of insulin,
   and higher insulin levels cause carbohydrate to be stored easily as
   fat. Eating a high-protein diet leads to weight loss, decreased insulin
   levels, and improved glycemia. However, neither this nor the claim to
   "cure" insulin resistancethe oversecretion of insulin which they say
   causes carbohydrate to be stored as fatwith a low-carbohydrate,
   high-protein diet is supported by scientific evidence.

   Nor is there good evidence that insulin resistance from eating a diet
   rich in starchy foods and sugar is the cause of obesity. In fact, it is
   obesity that causes insulin resistance, not the other way around. But
   regardless, increased physical activity, energy restriction and/or
   moderate weight loss, and controlling fat intake have been shown to
   improve insulin sensitivity, not changes in the protein-to-carbohydrate
   ratio.^42,43

   High-protein diets claim to offer other benefits. For example, protein
   stimulates the release of glucagon, a hormone that raises the level of
   blood glucose and counteracts the actions of insulin, and eating right
   means balancing insulin and glucagon levels. Therefore, the argument
   goes, if not enough protein is eaten, too much insulin is released and
   not enough glucagon. It is true that the balance of insulin and
   glucagon release is important in the metabolism and storage of
   nutrients. But it is doubtful that you can change the balance by eating
   more protein.

   Another claim is that if the right kinds of fat are eaten, individuals
   will not become fat. However, there appears to be a hierarchy for the
   autoregulation of substrate utilization and storage that is determined
   by storage capacity and specific fuel needs of certain tissues.^44 For
   example, alcohol has the highest priority for oxidation because there
   is no body storage pool for it, and conversion of alcohol to fat is
   energetically expensive. Amino acids and carbohydrates are next in the
   oxidative hierarchy. Body proteins are functional, and there are not
   storage depots for amino acids. There is a limited capacity to store
   carbohydrate as glycogen, and conversion of carbohydrate to fat is
   energetically expensive as well. In contrast, there is virtually
   unlimited storage capacity for fat, largely in adipose tissue, and the
   storage efficiency of fat is high. Because of the oxidative priority of
   alcohol and protein, the body has an exceptional ability to maintain
   their balance across a wide range of intake of each. Carbohydrate
   oxidation closely matches carbohydrate intake.^45,46 Therefore, the
   amount of fat oxidized or stored is the difference between total energy
   needs and the oxidation of the other priority fuelsalcohol, protein,
   and carbohydrate.

   Protein, Satiety, and Weight Loss
   The effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate on regulation of energy
   intake, weight loss, and satiety have been studied, but little research
   has been done related to protein. Short-term studies have suggested
   that protein exerts a more positive effect on satiety per calorie than
   both carbohydrate and fat.^47-49 However, this may not translate into
   eating fewer calories. Stubbs et al.,^49 in a 1-day study, reported
   that although subjective hunger was less after a high-protein breakfast
   compared to a high-fat or high-carbohydrate breakfast, lunch-time
   intake 5 hours later and energy intake for the rest of the day were
   similar after all three breakfasts.

   Skov et al.^50 studied the effect on weight loss in obese subjects of
   replacement of carbohydrate by protein in ad libitum fat-reduced diets.
   Food was supplied to the 50 subjects for 6 months and could be consumed
   ad libitum. The diets were low in fat (30% of energy) with a group
   randomly assigned to either a high-protein (25% protein, 45%
   carbohydrate) or high-carbohydrate (12% protein, 58% carbohydrate)
   diet. At 6 months, the high-protein group had lost 8.9 kg (20 lb) with
   a fat loss of 7.6 kg (17 lb) compared to the high-carbohydrate group
   loss of 5.1 kg (11 lb) and fat loss of 4.3 kg (9 lb).

   Over the course of the study, energy intake was lower in the
   high-protein group by ~8,000 calories (~42 kcal/day), which probably
   accounted for the difference in weight loss. The researchers attributed
   the decrease in calories to the higher satiating effect of protein
   compared to carbohydrate. The real test of effectiveness would be to
   follow the subjects for the next 2 years to identify food choices after
   the completion of the study and to determine if weight lost during the
   study was maintained.

   Aside from the problem that no long-term research is available to
   document that high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets maintain weight loss
   any better than traditional weight-loss diets,^51 what are other
   concerns? A major concern is that foods with proven health benefit are
   eliminated. There are health needs for the nutrients found in grains,
   fruits, vegetables, milk, and other carbohydrate-containing foods. When
   analyzed, these diets are seriously short of essential nutrients, such
   as vitamins C and D, folic acid, and especially calcium. The excess
   protein also has the potential to cause the body to lose what little
   calcium is ingested.

   A typical day's menu for women from one of the popular diets reveals
   that it contains ~1,200 calories and less than half of the RDA for the
   B vitamins, iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper. The meal plan for men
   contains ~1,700 calories and less than half of the RDA for the B
   vitamins, magnesium, and copper.^52 Taking a supplement to replace
   missing nutrients is not the complete solution either, because all of
   the essential nutrients found in foods have not yet been identified and
   so cannot be replaced. These diets are also low in fiber, which can
   contribute to constipation.

   Should health professionals recommend a diet known to be nutritionally
   inadequate to people with diabetes in an effort to improve blood
   glucose control? This is an ethical question that deserves an answer.

   As noted earlier, foods rich in protein are often high in fat,
   especially saturated fats and cholesterol, and the long-term effects on
   lipids from these diets is unknown. A study of subjects following a
   high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks reported substantial
   increases in plasma levels of both uric acid and low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol, decreases in triglycerides, but no increase in
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, despite effective weight
   loss.^53

   With only three macronutrients to manipulatecarbohydrate, protein, and
   fatthere are not many options left to sell a new diet book. We have
   gone through the high-carbohydrate approach, and it is unlikely that a
   high-fat approach will go far, so we are left with recycling the
   high-protein diet. However, moderation is generally the best approach:
   eating a healthful diet, being more physically active, and keeping food
   records along with blood glucose records so that blood glucose levels
   can be kept under optimal control. Although long-term research is
   needed, a better direction to study may be a moderate protein and
   carbohydrate, low-fat diet instead of the current popular high-protein,
   higher-fat, low-carbohydrate diets.

   The bottom line: people are obese not because they eat too many
   carbohydrates, but because they eat too many calories. Eating
   carbohydrates does not make people fat unless they overeat
   carbohydrates (just as when they overeat protein and fat). There is
   evidence that high levels of dietary fat are associated with high
   levels of obesity,^54 but there is no evidence that high intake of
   "simple" sugars or carbohydrates, unless they contribute to a high
   caloric intake, are associated with high levels of obesity.

   We are reminded that popularity is not credibility. There is little
   research published in peer-reviewed journals to support the
   low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets. High-protein diet books are based
   on personal experiences and testimonials and contain theories that
   usually would not survive peer review. Authors quote their own studies
   as proof. However, their studies have not shown this to be an approach
   that individuals can follow long-term. Long-term studies are necessary
   to determine how long individuals can comfortably consume a
   high-protein diet in the world outside of the research lab.

   Focus on Blood Glucose Control, Not Weight Loss
   Perhaps we need to ask why we have focused lifestyle changes for type 2
   diabetes on weight loss instead of on improving blood glucose control?
   Certainly, all of us would like to be able to help individuals lose and
   maintain weight loss, but research reveals little long-term success.^50
   Research is clarifying why weight loss is difficult^55-57 and
   documenting the psychological problems associated with the dieting
   process.^58 Obesity is associated with the development of chronic
   diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and prevention of chronic diseases
   may require a better understanding of what controls appetite and better
   tools, including medications, to prevent weight gain or assist in
   weight loss. However, treatment for individuals who already have type 2
   diabetes needs to focus on lifestyle strategies for the improvement of
   the associated metabolic abnormalities.

   Early in the course of the disease when insulin resistance is present,
   energy restriction not related to weight loss and moderate weight loss
   (10% of body weight or 1020 lb) have been shown to improve insulin
   sensitivity.^59-63 But as the disease progresses and insulin deficiency
   becomes the central issue, it may be too late for weight loss to be
   helpful.^64 Furthermore, mortality is not related to obesity (body mass
   index) in people with type 2 diabetes,^65,66 nor is obesity associated
   with the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes.^67,68 Many
   of the long-term problems associated with type 2 diabetes are
   associated with glycemic control.^69 Preliminary research suggests that
   even if weight loss is maintained over 12 months in subjects with type
   2 diabetes, initial HbA[1c] improvements are not maintained.^70

   Therefore, the focus should be on controlling blood glucose (and lipid)
   levels, not on weight loss. Teaching people carbohydrate counting,
   encouraging physical activity, keeping food records, and monitoring
   blood glucose levels are essential.^71,72 The diet doesn't fail; the
   pancreas and treatment protocol fail. Furthermore, all glucose-lowering
   medications work more effectively when used in combination with medical
   nutrition therapy.

   Protein Needs and Type 2 Diabetes
   It had been assumed that, in people with type 2 diabetes, abnormalities
   of protein metabolism are less sensitive to insufficient insulin action
   than those of glucose. However, studies by Gougeon et al.^73,74 have
   demonstrated that moderate hyperglycemia can contribute to an increased
   turnover of protein in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with an
   obese control group. The maintenance of body composition and nitrogen
   equilibrium are at the "cost" of more rapid turnover of protein and
   require sufficient energy and protein intakes. Insufficient protein
   intake does not support nitrogen equilibrium. To obtain positive
   nitrogen balance requires glycemic control, either via exogenous
   insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), and a higher protein
   intake.^74-76 In contrast to subjects who did not have diabetes,
   euglycemia with a very-low-energy diet did not completely reestablish
   nitrogen equilibrium in people with type 2 diabetes.^73,75 Furthermore,
   when energy is restricted, a higher protein intake is required for
   maintaining lean body mass while selectively mobilizing fat.^77

   This suggests that people with type 2 diabetes have an altered adaptive
   mechanism for protein sparing, independent of protein quality.^73,75
   Previous studies have suggested that smaller amounts of circulating
   insulin are sufficient to prevent protein loss in type 2
   diabetes.^78,79 It appears abnormalities of protein metabolism are
   present even with mild hyperglycemia. The threshold for abnormal
   nitrogen synthesis and breakdown is reported to be at a fasting
   glycemia between 6 and 7 mmol/l (108125 mg/dl).^80 Therefore, with
   moderate energy restriction there is need for a generous dietary
   protein intake (~1 g/kg body weight). However, this is not more than
   the amount of protein consumed on a usual basis by people with type 2
   diabetes. Treatment of type 2 diabetes that consists of OHAs or
   insulin, moderate energy restriction, and adequate protein intake not
   only improves glucose and lipids, but also is able to correct several
   aspects of whole-body protein metabolism.

   Protein Needs and Type 1 Diabetes
   Protein degradation and conversion of both endogenous and exogenous
   protein to glucose in type 1 diabetes depends on the state of
   insulinization and degree of glycemic control. In insulin-deficient
   individuals, both limited and excess dietary protein can have adverse
   effects. Conversion of excess dietary or endogenous protein to glucose
   may adversely influence glycemic regulation. On the other hand, these
   individuals might be more susceptible to body protein loss during
   dietary protein restriction. Definitive answers to these concerns are
   still unknown.^81

   Insulin deficiency increases both whole-body protein synthesis and
   protein breakdown with oxidation of essential amino acids.^82 However,
   the synthesis and degradation might not involve the same proteins.
   Gluconeogenesis also is increased, and hepatic extraction of alanine, a
   key amino acid gluconeogenic precursor, is accelerated.^19 Excessive
   rates of hepatic glucose production, proteolysis, and amino acid
   oxidation in type 1 diabetes are all reduced by insulin
   administration,^82 but proteolysis and amino acid oxidation are more
   resistant to the suppressive effects of insulin.^83 Normalization of
   protein metabolic rates may, therefore, require long-term tight
   metabolic control.^84 Today, with improved glycemic management in type
   1 diabetes, a more normal protein synthesis, breakdown, and oxidation
   should occur.

   Summary
   Let's review recommendations given to people with diabetes in regard to
   protein and try to determine if the research supports any or all of
   them.
     * "Proteins are foods like meat, cheese, and peanut butter." Only
       partly true; in most cases these foods are protein-plus-fats.
     * "Between 5060% of protein becomes glucose and enters the
       bloodstream about 34 hours after eaten." Perhaps 5060% of protein
       goes through the process of gluconeogenesis in the liver, but
       virtually none of this glucose enters into the general circulation.
     * "Don't eat fruit, fruit juice, or a sweet for a snack without also
       eating a source of protein to slow the absorption of carbohydrate."
       In none of the studies reviewed did added protein slow or change
       the peak postprandial glucose response.
     * "Bedtime snacks should always contain protein." No clear answer is
       available, but protein may not be needed. Even if protein is added,
       the effect on blood glucose levels is not great. However, people
       with diabetes (without renal disease) can be advised to eat an
       extra serving of protein rather than carbohydrate at meals or for
       snacks if they are still hungry after eating their usual
       carbohydrate servings.
     * "Treat an insulin reaction with a fast-acting carbohydrate, and add
       protein to provide a later source of blood glucose. This will
       prevent the blood glucose from dropping too low again." One small
       study concluded that adding protein to the treatment of
       hypoglycemia only added unwanted or unneeded calories. Would this
       also be true when protein is added to bedtime snacks? Furthermore,
       the term "fast-acting carbohydrate" should be eliminated.
     * "Eating too much protein can damage the kidneys." In people with
       diabetes, no evidence supports the claim that protein intakes <20%
       of total daily caloric intake contribute to the development of
       renal disease.

   What about the high-protein, low carbohydrate diets? Initial results
   are often dramatic in terms of weight loss and impact on glycemia, but
   no long-term controlled clinical research has been done. We do not know
   if individuals follow these types of diets any better long-term than
   other low-calorie diets or whether weight loss would be maintained if
   they did. We also do not know the long-term effect of such diets on
   blood glucose levels and overall health.

   Although protein ingestion increases circulating insulin in all people,
   in obese people with type 2 diabetes, the insulin secretion to protein
   is greater than in subjects without diabetes.^10,85 In people without
   diabetes, protein is a relatively weak stimulant of insulin compared to
   glucose,^9 while in people with type 2 diabetes who are still able to
   secrete considerable amounts of insulin, protein and carbohydrate are
   equal in stimulating insulin response, and when combined the insulin
   response is additive in people without diabetes but is synergistic in
   people with type 2 diabetes.^9,10 Stimulating endogenous insulin can be
   viewed as a positive or a negativenegative because of the potential
   endogenous hyperinsulinemia and its association with insulin resistance
   and cardiovascular disease; positive because protein ingested with
   carbohydrate can have a synergistic effect on insulin, thus improving
   the postprandial response to carbohydrate.

   Obtaining positive nitrogen balance in people with type 2 diabetes
   requires glycemic control and adequate protein intake, especially when
   energy intake is restricted. Fortunately, the large amount of protein
   in the customary diet of people with diabetes compensates for the
   increased protein catabolism and thus protects from protein
   malnutrition.^86

   In people with type 1 diabetes, the effect of protein on glycemia will
   be dependent on the state of insulinization and the degree of glycemic
   control. Protein requires insulin for metabolism, as do carbohydrate
   and fat, but has minimal effects on blood glucose levels. In
   well-controlled diabetes, large amounts of protein have the potential
   to contribute to glucose production, minimally increase blood glucose
   levels, and require additional small amounts of insulin. If protein is
   decreased, insulin doses may also need to be decreased. There is
   limited evidence to suggest that protein contributes to a sustained
   elevation of blood glucose levels, slows absorption of carbohydrate, or
   is helpful for the treatment of hypoglycemia.

   Finally, the focus should shift from debating the ideal percentages of
   calories from macronutrients and instead should focus on the goals of
   diabetes medical nutrition therapy and strategies known to assist in
   achieving these goals. Nutrition recommendations must be individualized
   based on treatment goals and an assessment of what the individual is
   currently eating, what changes might be beneficial, and the changes the
   individual is willing and able to make. People with diabetes need
   accurate information on which to base their decisions, because
   ultimately they make the final decision as to what they will eat.
