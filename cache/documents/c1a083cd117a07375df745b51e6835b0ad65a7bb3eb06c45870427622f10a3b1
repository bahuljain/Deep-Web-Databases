   Best Answer:  Your understanding of the law is very flawed.
   Also, you mentioned "shareware" in your question but in the details -
   you completely changed the subject.
   None of those things you mentioned are shareware. They have nothing to
   do with it at all.
   Only if the copyright holder designates it as shareware does it become
   shareware. You, the person aquiring cannot stamp a label of shareware
   on it to suit yourself. A third party acting as an unauthorized
   publisher cannot stamp a label of shareware on it either. Only the
   copyright holder can do that.
   To put it simply: shareware is legal, none of the things you listed are
   shareware, and the activities you mentioned are all or mostly illegal.
   At least they are if the music you are describing is copyrighted.
   Commercial copyright holders tend to go after copyright infringers. The
   maximum civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringment in the
   US can be equal to the cost of several homes.
   I am not a lawyer but maybe you should speak to one for advice before
   you need to speak to one for a defense.
   You might wind up speaking to a lawyer for the music industry trade
   association. Instead of compounding your risks, I urge you to do a
   little reading on what copyrights and intellectual property laws are
   all about before you get carried away.
   There is something called the home recording act in the US that has to
   do with the ability of consumers to record music or videos played by
   broadcasters over the air.
   However, that is different than what you are talking about. The
   broadcasters themselves pay the royalties to the copyright holders in
   that case.

       I think you don't really know what shareware is. It's not when you
       "share" your programs. Shareware has been around a long time.
       Companies would purposely make versions, betas, trial versions for
       people to try and share with their friends for marketing and
       development purposes.
       As to sharing copyrighted programs technically sites like limewire
       aren't doing anything illeagle and they tell you when something
       does not have certification to be shared, you choose to do the
       illegal part and down load it for free.

       Limeware, BearShare etc aren't ShareWare programs. They are 'file
       sharing' programs.
       ShareWare programs are given to users for free by companies wishing
       to give users use of their program for free, sometimes for a trial
       period.
       There is a big distinction between the two terms because file
       sharing programs *usually* involve illegally-shared files, while
       shareware is usually legally-shared by its nature

       Shareware is legal. It is basically a software demo, like how with
       some Xbox games you can play demos of a couple other games, only
       you don't have to pay to get them. Sometimes, like the demo of
       Sibelius 3, the save feature is disabled. Shareware is perfectly
       legal to get and copy, it's just illegal to sell without a license
       to do so.

       Shareware is a type of software that is supposed to be shared.
       However, software, music, videos, etc. shared over P2P networks is
       not usually shareware. Private software that is not liscensed to be
       shared is illegal to share across P2P networks. Right now, the
       MPAA, etc. are only prosecuting users of these networks that share
       the software, but that doesn't mean they won't try to go after
       everyone else.
