   Best Answer:  Some of the symptoms of diabetes (other names for it are
   high blood sugar and hyperglycemia) are extreme thirst, frequent
   urination, dry skin, hunger, blurred vision, drowsiness, and nausea.
   The only way you can really tell is to have a blood test done.

       I have type1, usually diagnosed in children and young adults, I
       found out I had it at 18. Symptoms are the basically the same for
       both Type 1 and Type 2. As far as finding out if you are a
       diabetic, you will need to have you blood sugar tested. A fasting
       blood sugar will let the doctors know, you may be asked to do this
       test a couple of times, to compare test results.
       The best place to start learning about diabetes is the - American
       Diabetes Association you can visit them at: www.diabetes.org I
       recommend checking it out.
       Well wishes,

       Blurred vision, weight gain, but the most obvious sign is an
       unquenchable thirst. A simple blood test from your doctor can
       confirm or deny diabetes

       Some people who are diagnosed with diabetes haven't experienced any
       diabetes symptoms ? their diabetes was diagnosed from the results
       of a simple blood test.
       Many people, however, may notice one or more of the following
       diabetes warning signs:
       Urinating frequently. Since your kidneys must remove the excess
       glucose from your blood, it ends up in your urine, which can cause
       more frequent urination with more volume.
       Increased thirst. When you lose an increased amount of fluid
       through frequent urination, you may become dehydrated and thirsty.
       You?ll notice that you are drinking more fluids to stay hydrated.
       Excessive hunger. You may notice that you feel hungry all the time.
       Your body is unable to use the glucose you have and is trying to
       tell you it needs more fuel.
       Unexplained weight loss. Since your body is unable to use your
       blood glucose effectively, it begins to break down your energy
       stores such as fat, which can result in weight loss or a failure to
       gain weight in growing children. This can happen even though you
       are hungry and eating more.
       Fatigue. Feeling tired is a common diabetes symptom because your
       body cannot convert the glucose in your blood into usable energy.
       Irritable mood. Along with hunger and fatigue, it is not uncommon
       to feel irritable when you have diabetes.
       Blurred vision. High blood glucose levels can cause you to
       temporarily experience blurred vision.

       is a syndrome characterized by disordered metabolism and
       inappropriately high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) resulting from
       either low levels of the hormone insulin or from abnormal
       resistance to insulin's effects coupled with inadequate levels of
       insulin secretion to compensate.The characteristic symptoms are
       excessive urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst and
       increased fluid intake (polydipsia), and blurred vision; these
       symptoms are likely absent if the blood sugar is only mildly
       elevated.
       Type 1 diabetes mellitus
       Main article: Diabetes mellitus type 1
       Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the
       insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the
       pancreas, leading to a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of
       this beta cell loss is a T-cell mediated autoimmune attack.[4]
       There is no known preventative measure that can be taken against
       type 1 diabetes, which comprises up to 10% of diabetes mellitus
       cases in North America and Europe (though this varies by
       geographical location). Most affected people are otherwise healthy
       and of a healthy weight when onset occurs. Sensitivity and
       responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially in the
       early stages. Type 1 diabetes can affect children or adults but was
       traditionally termed "juvenile diabetes" because it represents a
       majority of cases of diabetes affecting children.
       The principal treatment of type 1 diabetes, even from the earliest
       stages, is replacement of insulin combined with careful monitoring
       of blood glucose levels using blood testing monitors. Without
       insulin, diabetic ketoacidosis can develop and may result in coma
       or death. Emphasis is also placed on lifestyle adjustments (diet
       and exercise) though these cannot reverse the loss. Apart from the
       common subcutaneous injections, it is also possible to deliver
       insulin by a pump, which allows continuous infusion of insulin 24
       hours a day at preset levels, and the ability to program doses (a
       bolus) of insulin as needed at meal times. An inhaled form of
       insulin, Exubera, was approved by the FDA in January 2006.[8]
       Type 1 treatment must be continued indefinitely. Treatment does not
       impair normal activities, if sufficient awareness, appropriate
       care, and discipline in testing and medication is taken. The
       average glucose level for the type 1 patient should be as close to
       normal (80‚Äì120 mg/dl, 4‚Äì6 mmol/l) as possible. Some physicians
       suggest up to 140‚Äì150 mg/dl (7-7.5 mmol/l) for those having trouble
       with lower values, such as frequent hypoglycemic events. Values
       above 200 mg/dl (10 mmol/l) are often accompanied by discomfort and
       frequent urination leading to dehydration. Values above 300 mg/dl
       (15 mmol/l) usually require immediate treatment and may lead to
       ketoacidosis. Low levels of blood glucose, called hypoglycemia, may
       lead to seizures or episodes of unconsciousness.
       [edit] Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
       Main article: Diabetes mellitus type 2
       Type 2 diabetes mellitus is due to insulin resistance or reduced
       insulin sensitivity, combined with reduced insulin secretion. The
       defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin almost
       certainly involves the insulin receptor in cell membranes. In the
       early stage the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin
       sensitivity, characterized by elevated levels of insulin in the
       blood. At this stage hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of
       measures and medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce
       glucose production by the liver. As the disease progresses the
       impairment of insulin secretion worsens, and therapeutic
       replacement of insulin often becomes necessary.
       There are numerous theories as to the exact cause and mechanism in
       type 2 diabetes. Central obesity (fat concentrated around the waist
       in relation to abdominal organs, but not subcutaneous fat) is known
       to predispose individuals for insulin resistance. Abdominal fat is
       especially active hormonally, secreting a group of hormones called
       adipokines that may possibly impair glucose tolerance. Obesity is
       found in approximately 55% of patients diagnosed with type 2
       diabetes.[9] Other factors include aging (about 20% of elderly
       patients in North America have diabetes) and family history (type 2
       is much more common in those with close relatives who have had it).
       In the last decade, type 2 diabetes has increasingly begun to
       affect children and adolescents, likely in connection with the
       increased prevalence of childhood obesity seen in recent decades in
       some places.[10]
       Type 2 diabetes may go unnoticed for years because visible symptoms
       are typically mild, non-existent or sporadic, and usually there are
       no ketoacidotic episodes. However, severe long-term complications
       can result from unnoticed type 2 diabetes, including renal failure
       due to diabetic nephropathy, vascular disease (including coronary
       artery disease), vision damage due to diabetic retinopathy, loss of
       sensation or pain due to diabetes neuropathy, and liver damage from
       non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
       Type 2 diabetes is usually first treated by increasing physical
       activity, decreasing carbohydrate intake, and losing weight. These
       can restore insulin sensitivity even when the weight loss is
       modest, for example around 5 kg (10 to 15 lb), most especially when
       it is in abdominal fat deposits. It is sometimes possible to
       achieve long-term, satisfactory glucose control with these measures
       alone. However, the underlying tendency to insulin resistance is
       not lost, and so attention to diet, exercise, and weight loss must
       continue. The usual next step, if necessary, is treatment with oral
       antidiabetic drugs. Insulin production is initially only moderately
       impaired in type 2 diabetes, so oral medication (often used in
       various combinations) can be used to improve insulin production
       (e.g., sulfonylureas), to regulate inappropriate release of glucose
       by the liver and attenuate insulin resistance to some extent (e.g.,
       metformin), and to substantially attenuate insulin resistance
       (e.g., thiazolidinediones). According to one study, overweight
       patients treated with metformin compared with diet alone, had
       relative risk reductions of 32% for any diabetes endpoint, 42% for
       diabetes related death and 36% for all cause mortality and
       stroke.[11] Oral medication may eventually fail due to further
       impairment of beta cell insulin secretion. At this point, insulin
       therapy is necessary to maintain normal or near normal glucose
       levels.
       The classical triad of diabetes symptoms is polyuria, polydipsia
       and polyphagia, which are, respectively, frequent urination;
       increased thirst and consequent increased fluid intake; and
       increased appetite. Symptoms may develop quite rapidly (weeks or
       months) in type 1 diabetes, particularly in children. However, in
       type 2 diabetes the symptoms develop much more slowly and may be
       subtle or completely absent. Type 1 diabetes may also cause weight
       loss (despite normal or increased eating) and irreducible fatigue.
       These symptoms can also manifest in type 2 diabetes in patients
       whose diabetes is poorly controlled.
       When the glucose concentration in the blood is raised beyond the
       renal threshold, reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal
       tubuli is incomplete, and part of the glucose remains in the urine
       (glycosuria). This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and
       inhibits the reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in
       increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss.
       Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in
       body cells, causing dehydration and increased thirst.
       Prolonged high blood glucose causes glucose absorption, which leads
       to changes in the shape of the lenses of the eyes, resulting in
       vision changes. Blurred vision is a common complaint leading to a
       diabetes diagnosis; type 1 should always be suspected in cases of
       rapid vision change whereas type 2 is generally more gradual, but
       should still be suspected.
       Patients (usually with type 1 diabetes) may also present with
       diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), an extreme state of metabolic
       dysregulation characterized by the smell of acetone on the
       patient's breath; a rapid, deep breathing known as Kussmaul
       breathing; polyuria; nausea; vomiting and abdominal pain; and any
       of many altered states of consciousness or arousal (such as
       hostility and mania or, equally, confusion and lethargy). In severe
       DKA, coma may follow, progressing to death. Diabetic ketoacidosis
       is a medical emergency and requires hospital admission.
       A rarer but equally severe possibility is hyperosmolar nonketotic
       state, which is more common in type 2 diabetes and is mainly the
       result of dehydration due to loss of body water. Often, the patient
       has been drinking extreme amounts of sugar-containing drinks,
       leading to a vicious circle in regard to the water loss.
       Screening
       Diabetes screening is recommended for many people at various stages
       of life, and for those with any of several risk factors. The
       screening test varies according to circumstances and local policy,
       and may be a random blood glucose test, a fasting blood glucose
       test, a blood glucose test two hours after 75 g of glucose, or an
       even more formal glucose tolerance test. Many healthcare providers
       recommend universal screening for adults at age 40 or 50, and often
       periodically thereafter. Earlier screening is typically recommended
       for those with risk factors such as obesity, family history of
       diabetes, high-risk ethnicity (Mestizo/Hispanic, Native American,
       Afro-Caribbean, Pacific Island, and South Asian ancestry).[16][17]
       Many medical conditions are associated with diabetes and warrant
       screening. A partial list includes: high blood pressure, elevated
       cholesterol levels, coronary artery disease, past gestational
       diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, fatty
       liver, hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis, several mitochondrial
       neuropathies and myopathies, myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich's
       ataxia, some of the inherited forms of neonatal hyperinsulinism.
       The risk of diabetes is higher with chronic use of several
       medications, including high-dose glucocorticoids, some chemotherapy
       agents (especially L-asparaginase), as well as some of the
       antipsychotics and mood stabilizers (especially phenothiazines and
       some atypical antipsychotics).
