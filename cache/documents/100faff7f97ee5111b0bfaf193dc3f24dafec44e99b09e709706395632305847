What’s the Best Way to Measure Body Fat?

   When it comes to monitoring body fat, the scale leaves a lot to be
   desired. Weight alone doesn’t indicate fitness—the needle moves for fat
   and muscle alike. Even for those not battling the bulge, body fat
   testing can be a nifty way to measure training progress and overall
   body composition. But not all methods measure up. Read on to learn
   about the madness behind the measurement—and whether it’s worth the
   trouble at all.

   The “biggest” (most inconvenient) and “best” (most expensive) methods
   Researchers have debated the ideal way to measure body fat for years,
   testing, comparing, and refining formulas all to determine the best
   approach. For the general public, however, it will likely come down to
   availability—most people will simply have to use whichever of these
   systems is closest to them (that is, unless they want [98]to get very
   DIY). And since most body fat testing formulas are based on regression
   models, the further a subject is from an average height and
   weight—often young individuals of average weight—the less accurate
   their results will tend to be.

   It’s all water weight: Hydrostatic weighing. Hydrostatic weighing is
   one of the oldest methods still in use, tracing its roots back to the
   principals from Archimedes’ famous bath. People sit atop a scale that’s
   dunked in water, and their weight (dry and submerged) plus the amount
   of water splashed out is used to calculate their body’s density. From
   there, fancy formulas are used to estimate body fat. Unfortunately, all
   of this can be thrown off by natural differences in bone density,
   hydration level, or the air left in those water-wings we call lungs.

   Fat analysis is a breeze: Air displacement plethysmography. Enter the
   Bod Pod. This device also uses Archimedes’ Principle, but with air
   rather than water (this makes things considerably more simple though
   not necessarily more accurate). Instead of exhaling all the air in your
   lungs and plunging into a carnival-esque dunk tank, there’s just some
   skimpy clothing, a 15 minute time commitment, and anywhere from a $10
   to $75 fee—assuming you can find a facility that owns one of these
   pricey machines on [102]the web (or… a [103]Pinterest board?).

   Only skin deep: Duel energy X-ray absorptiometry. Ease of use has
   contributed to the Bod Pod’s popularity, but for researchers it’s been
   gradually replaced by DEXA scans, generally regarded as the most
   dependable method for measuring body fat (Dual Energy X-ray
   Absorptiometry, for those who want to sound official). While DEXA isn’t
   without its problems (there’s variability between machines, and a scan
   can cost $200 or more), it’s generally thought to be at least as
   accurate as a Bod Pod and has the added benefit of being able to
   identify where fat is deposited in the body.

   The cheapest and easiest methods
   The hassle and expense of underwater weighing, Bod Pods, and DEXA
   precludes all but the most curious from getting their body composition
   tested. For those with a more idle interest (and a mean online shopping
   habit), there are a number of cheaper, at-home testing methods.

   You’ll get pinched: Skinfold test. The skinfold test is an old standby
   where calipers (think of them as a cross between giant tweezers and a
   geometric compass) measure several body parts to see how much fat is
   lurking beneath the skin—and where. The results are plugged into any
   number of equations that estimate body fat using population averages
   (these equations have been popular for decades, but in an effort to
   improve reliability many more have been devised). This is fine for
   epidemiological studies (or at least used to be), but isn’t terribly
   helpful for individuals looking to longitudinally measure the effect
   of, say, dropping beer from a diet. Another huge factor to consider is
   the experience of the person performing the test—aka pinching with
   those giant tweezers—which can have a dramatic impact on final results.

   A shocking body: Bioelectric impedance. Another popular option is
   Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA), which is how those fancy scales
   at the gym estimate body fat. Electricity moves through tissues (like
   fat and muscle) differently, and that change in conductivity can be
   used to figure out relative fat mass, though it’s debated if this
   method is more accurate than caliper use by a knowledgeable pro. While
   these $30 (give or take) devices can give you a decent base reading,
   they aren’t sensitive enough to accurately detect small changes (think
   day to day) so any progress they register will likely be apparent to
   the naked eye already. Factors like hydration and recent exercise can
   also affect BIA readings.

   The takeaway
   Every method has its drawbacks, but what advantage does somebody have
   knowing their true body fat percentage anyway? So long as there’s
   improvement on the field, track, scale, or weight room without a
   noticeable loss of muscle/addition of fat, that’s probably positive
   progress. Research indicates that people are notoriously bad at gauging
   their own body composition, but with a little help, both the
   aesthetically and athletically minded can get a pretty good
   guesstimate. But with plenty of variability in body fat testing, it’s
   usually best to put more energy into exercise and diet than measuring
   every little inch.
