Hospital-Acquired Infections Cost $10 Billion a Year: Study

   September 3, 2013
     __________________________________________________________________

   [janitor_18262.jpg]

   By Brenda Goodman
   HealthDay Reporter

   TUESDAY, Sept. 3 (HealthDay News) — The five most common infections
   that patients get after they’ve been admitted to the hospital cost the
   U.S. health care system almost $10 billion a year, a new study shows.

   One out of every 20 patients who are admitted to a hospital will fall
   victim to an infection they pick up while there, according to the U.S.
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These infections can be
   serious and even life-threatening, and recent studies have estimated
   that as many as half of them may be preventable.

   They are also expensive to treat. In 2006, in a bid to get hospitals to
   do more to prevent so-called health care-associated infections,
   Medicare stopped paying for patient care associated with certain
   serious health care-associated infections.

   The new study from Harvard researchers, which was published online
   Sept. 2 in JAMA Internal Medicine, suggests that by focusing prevention
   efforts on surgical site infections, infections associated with the use
   of devices such as central lines, catheters and ventilators, and by
   guarding against infections caused by Clostridium difficile, hospitals
   could save substantial amounts of money.

   “This is real money, I mean real money,” said Dr. Trish Perl, a
   professor of medicine and pathology at the Johns Hopkins School of
   Public Health in Baltimore.

   Perl recently completed a study of surgical site infections at four
   hospitals in the Johns Hopkins Health System. Her study concluded that
   if the hospitals could eliminate surgical site infections tied to the
   procedures they studied, they would see an increase in revenue of more
   than $2 million a year. She wasn’t involved in the current research.

   “Cost data like this is one of the tools we’ve got to get out there,”
   Perl said.

   To compile the new numbers, researchers conducted a meta-analysis, or a
   study of studies, to estimate the costs associated with each of the
   different kinds of infections. They used a large, national database
   maintained by the CDC to estimate the number of health care-associated
   infections. And they built mathematical models to incorporate
   variations in patient outcomes and to see how those variations impacted
   costs.

   The study was funded by a donation promoting research on patient
   safety.

   Central line-associated bloodstream infections averaged about $45,000
   per case. Pneumonia infections that strike patients who are put on
   ventilators to help them breathe cost about $40,000 per case. The most
   common infections, surgical site infections, which happen in about one
   out of every 50 operations, cost around $21,000 each to treat. There
   are about four C. difficile infections for every 1,000 patients who
   spend a day in the hospital, making them the second most common kind of
   infection, and those cost about $11,000 each to treat. Urinary tract
   infections associated with the use of catheters cost about $900 each.

   The researchers say their numbers probably underestimate the true cost
   of treating health care-associated infections.

   “We’re not including every sort of infection, but these five would
   account for the majority of infections every way you look at it,” said
   Dr. Eyal Zimlichman, a research associate at the Center for Patient
   Safety at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We’re only looking
   at adults, we didn’t take pediatric infections into account,” he noted.
   They also limited their investigation to infections picked up in
   hospitals. They didn’t factor in infections acquired in other kinds of
   health care settings such as nursing homes and dialysis clinics.

   The narrow focus of the study, combined with progress made in reducing
   some kinds of infections, may help to explain why previous estimates of
   infection costs were higher, somewhere between $20 billion and $40
   billion a year, the study authors pointed out.

   There were also some surprises in the numbers.

   Though many hospitals have substantially increased their efforts to
   prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections, the new study
   found that while these infections are common, they account for less
   than 1 percent of all costs associated with health care-acquired
   infections.

   “From a cost perspective, at least, one might suggest this isn’t the
   first choice you want to put your emphasis on,” Zimlichman said.
