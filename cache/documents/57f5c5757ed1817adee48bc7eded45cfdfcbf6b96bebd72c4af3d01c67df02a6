   THURSDAY, Feb. 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) — At least 100 patients may
   have been exposed to medical devices contaminated with a “superbug” at
   the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, where the devices
   are already believed to be responsible for seven serious infections,
   including two deaths.

   Endoscopes that were used to perform digestive procedures between
   October and January were contaminated with Carbapenem-Resistant
   Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), hospital officials said Thursday.

   The hospital said about 100 patients may have been exposed to the
   contaminated devices. The Associated Press reported that 180 patients
   might be at risk.

   Free home-testing kits are being delivered to all potentially infected
   patients, and UCLA will analyze the results, the medical center said.

   The two endoscopes thought responsible for the infections were used in
   the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic and bile duct problems,
   hospital officials told the AP. These specialized devices, called
   duodenoscopes, are threaded through the digestive system, enabling
   doctors to diagnose abnormalities such as gallstones and cancers.

   “We notified all patients who had this type of procedure, and we were
   using seven different scopes. Only two of them were found to be
   infected. In an abundance of caution, we notified everybody,” said
   hospital spokeswoman Dale Tate.

   The duodenoscopes had been cleaned according to standards set by the
   manufacturer, the hospital said.

   “The two scopes involved with the infection were immediately removed,
   and UCLA is now utilizing a decontamination process that goes above and
   beyond the manufacturer and national standards,” the hospital said.

   The infection is hard to treat because CRE bacteria have become
   resistant to most available antibiotics. One prior report found that
   half of people with serious CRE infections die, according to the U.S.
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

   The bacterial infection occurs most often in health-care settings. Most
   people who develop CRE infections have existing health problems, the
   CDC said.

   Diseases caused by CRE bacteria include pneumonia, urinary tract
   infections and serious bloodstream or wound infections.

   The outbreak has alarmed disease experts.

   Because CRE infection is difficult to treat, this is a serious
   outbreak, Dr. Alex Kallen, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s Division of
   Healthcare Quality Promotion, told the Los Angeles Times.

   “This bacteria is emerging in the U.S., and it’s associated with a high
   mortality rate,” Kallen said. “We don’t want this circulating anywhere
   in the community.”

   The CDC said it doesn’t keep national figures on CRE infection, but it
   knows of 47 states with reported cases.
