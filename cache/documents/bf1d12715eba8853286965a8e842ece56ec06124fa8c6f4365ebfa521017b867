‘In Sickness and In Health’ Isn’t in the Cards for Many Women

   Unhappy-old-couple

   By Maureen Salamon
   HealthDay Reporter

   THURSDAY, May 1, 2014 (HealthDay News) — The marital vows to stay true
   “in sickness and in health” seem to apply more to wives than husbands
   when one of the spouses becomes seriously ill, according to novel new
   research.

   Social scientists found that the risk of divorce among older married
   heterosexual couples rises when the wife, but not the husband,
   experiences a health crisis such as cancer, heart problems, lung
   disease or stroke.

   “When the wives became ill, about 50 percent of the marriages ended in
   divorce,” said study author Amelia Karraker, a postdoctoral researcher
   at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. “We have
   strong prior [evidence] that there would be a gendered component to
   this, that it would be more likely that a wife’s illness would be more
   strongly associated with divorce than a husband’s. But it’s encouraging
   to see it borne out in data.”

   The study is scheduled to be presented May 1 at the annual meeting of
   the Population Association of America in Boston. Research presented at
   scientific conferences typically has not been published or
   peer-reviewed and results are considered preliminary.

   About 36 percent of all marriages end in divorce in the United States
   for any reason, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention.

   Karraker and her co-author analyzed 20 years of data on more than 2,700
   heterosexual marriages. At the time of the first interviews in 1992, at
   least one of the spouses was over the age of 50.

   The marital effect of the onset of four serious health crises — cancer,
   heart problems, lung disease and stroke — was examined, with more
   husbands than wives developing these conditions during the study.

   Only a few prior studies have examined the role of poor health in
   subsequent divorce, with mixed findings, and most of these
   investigations examined younger couples, Karraker said.

   She noted that the new study “speaks to a different season of life,”
   but her data didn’t indicate which spouse initiated divorce. Prior
   research suggests that women initiate about two-thirds of divorce
   proceedings.

   If the wife decides to exit the marriage after she becomes ill, it may
   be because she’s dissatisfied with how well her husband is caring for
   her, Karraker said. If the husband decides to leave, he may do so to
   pursue a relationship with a healthy partner.

   The new study couldn’t explain exactly why the divorce risk is elevated
   when wives become ill, but Karraker said she hopes to glean insight
   into these aspects through further research.

   Markie Blumer, an associate professor of human development and family
   studies at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, said she hopes more
   studies such as this examine relationships as people move through
   middle and late adulthood.

   Blumer, who praised the new study for its large sample size, said the
   results could spur important conversations and broaden support from
   clinicians and social services for couples experiencing the illness of
   one partner.

   “I think it’s really a wake-up call to people who are aging and their
   family members and health care providers that they need to be mindful
   about how an illness will affect your caregiving requirements,” said
   Blumer, who wasn’t involved in the new research. “Being a caregiver is
   one of the most stressful jobs a person can have.”
