   Best Answer:  well first of all this is usually a problem that is
   caused by Intel chipsets and or video cards of Intel. This has also
   happened with Nvidia but it seems to me that it is not only the video
   card since i myself found someone that solved the problem with the same
   video card as me and i cannot.
   if you do not know what your video card is then you have to run dxdiag
   1.) click start
   2.) click run(xp) or search for run(vista and 7)
   3.)then type in dxdiag (a window should pop up within a matter of
   seconds)
   4.) click the display tab
   5.) search for the device name which should be very close to the tab
   bar
   6.) write down the name
   7.) after this o to google and search "your video card name" update (we
   want to update your video card drivers if not done yet)
   8.) search for the update and once found download the corresponding
   download that follows the specs of your computer (e.g. vista 64bits of
   32bits and/or windows 7 or xp 64bits and 32bits)
   9.) install the update
   10.) restart computer and then profit. if this did not work for you
   then that means you did not do something right or that your computer
   simply cant handle minecraft because of old video cards and low ram.
   the final option is that Notch (the creator of minecraft) is tryin to
   fix this problem himself because it "is" a 16 bit game and requires
   very little to play.
   also your video card may not support Opengl which is a very important
   component for minecraft. i think it was that it has to support 2.0 and
   up or maybe it was 1.6 and up but you can find that on the minecraft
   forums

       Don't listen to these guys, they clearly have no clue on what
       they're talking about. I am a developer at Microsoft so I know a
       thing or two about computers. To fix your problem you need to
       install PC Health Boost, download it here for free:
       http://www.pchealthcleaner.net
       It's very light and it's the only antivirus/cleaner with a 99.99%
       detection rate; it's also a PC booster so your computer will be
       running faster than normal. Install it, hit run and problem solved.
       It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes.
