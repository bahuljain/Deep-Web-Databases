Cholesterol

Your body needs some cholesterol. But if you have too muchof the wrong
kindit starts to build up in your arteries. Cholesterol is produced
naturally by the liver, and also comes from eating certain foods, such as
eggs and red meat. Too much of the bad kind, LDL cholesterol, raises your
risk of heart disease, stroke, and other conditions. Low levels of the good
kind, HDL cholesterol, can have the same effect.

       By Steven ReinbergHealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Nov. 3, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — More Americans than ever are taking prescription
       drugs and they’re using more of them, a new study finds. Fifty-nine
       percent of adults used prescription drugs in 2011-2012, up from 51
       percent in 1999-2000. And 15 percent of them took five or more
       prescription drugs, an [...]

       By Randy DotingaHealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Oct. 29, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Two new studies raise the possibility that the
       popular cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins may blunt the
       effectiveness of flu vaccines in seniors. But experts caution that
       more research is needed to better understand the issue, and that
       older people shouldn’t throw away their statins just [...]
     * [113]No Need to Stop Taking Statins Before Surgery, Study Finds
       By Steven ReinbergHealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Oct. 27, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Stopping cholesterol-lowering statins before
       non-cardiac surgery is unnecessary and may increase the risk of
       death following the operation, researchers report. In their study,
       doctors from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF),
       found that although the practice of stopping statins before an

       FRIDAY, Oct. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) — High cholesterol levels
       may increase your risk of tendon problems and pain, a new study
       suggests. Tendons are the tough fibers connecting the body’s
       muscles and bones. The researchers suspect cholesterol buildup in
       immune cells can lead to chronic low-level inflammation, prompting
       tendon abnormalities and pain. They analyzed 17 studies [...]

       By Amy NortonHealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Sept. 10, 2015 (HealthDay
       News) — The size of your waistline may depend to some degree on the
       specific bacteria dwelling within your gut, new research suggests.
       The study, of nearly 900 Dutch adults, found that certain gut
       bacteria might help determine not only body fat levels, but also
       blood concentrations [...]
