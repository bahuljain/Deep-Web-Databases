   Activity [23]Calculate My Calories

   I don't do any physical activity other than what I need to do for my
   usual activities, such as going to work or school, grocery shopping, or
   doing chores around the house.

   I do some moderate exercise every day in addition to doing my usual
   activities. For example, I walk about 1.5 to 3 miles a day at about 3
   to 4 miles an hour. Or I do something else that's moderately active.

   I am very active every day in addition to doing my usual activities.
   For example, I walk more than 3 miles a day at about 3 to 4 miles an
   hour. Or I do something else that's very active.
