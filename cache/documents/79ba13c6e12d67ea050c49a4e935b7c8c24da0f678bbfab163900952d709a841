   Don't know if you have seen these, but they helped me when I was having
   similar struggles! Hang in there!!

   How God Selects The Mother Of A Child With Diabetes

   By: Erma Bombeck
   Most women become mothers by accident, some by choice, a few by social
   pressures and a couple by habit. Did you ever wonder how mothers of
   children with Diabetes are chosen? Somehow I visualize God hovering
   over Earth selecting his instruments for propagation with great care
   and deliberation. As he observes, he instructs his angels to make notes
   in a giant ledger.

   "Armstrong, Beth, son. Patron Saint Matthew."
   "Forrest, Marjorie, daughter. Patron Saint Cecilia."
   "Rutledge, Carrie, twins. Patron Saint Gerard. He's used to
   profanity."

   Finally, he passes a name to an angel and smiles, "Give her a child
   with Diabetes." The angel is curious. "Why this one, God? She's so
   happy."
   "Exactly", smiles God. "Could I give a child with Diabetes to a mother
   who does not know laughter? That would be cruel."

   "But has she the patience?" asks the angel.
   "I don't want her to have too much patience, or she will drown in a sea
   of self-pity and despair. Once the shock and resentment wear off,
   she'll handle it. I watched her today. She has that feeling of self and
   independence that is so rare and so necessary in a mother. You see, the
   child I am going to give her has her own world. She has to make it live
   in her world and that's not going to be easy."

   "But ,Lord, I don't think she even believes in you."
   God smiles. "No matter. I can fix that. This one is perfect. She has
   just enough selfishness."

   The angel gasps. "Selfishness? Is that a virtue?"
   God nods. "If she cannot separate herself from the child occasionally,
   she will never survive. Yes, this is a woman whom I will bless with
   less than perfect."

   "She does not realize it yet, but she is to be envied. I will permit
   her to see clearly the things I see....ignorance, cruelty,
   prejudice...and allow her to rise above them. She will never be alone.
   I will be at her side every minute of every day of her life because she
   is doing my work as surely as if she is here by my side."

   "And what about her Patron Saint?" asks the angel, his pen poised in
   mid air. God smiles. "A mirror will suffice."


   And then there is this one.....


   c1987 by Emily Perl Kingsley. All rights reserved

   I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a
   disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique
   experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like
   this......


   When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous
   vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your
   wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in
   Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very
   exciting.

   After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack
   your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The
   stewardess comes in and says, "Welcome to Holland."


   "Holland?!?" you say. "What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for
   Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going
   to Italy."

   But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland
   and there you must stay.

   The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible,
   disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's
   just a different place.


   So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole
   new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would
   never have met.

   It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy
   than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your
   breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has
   windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.


   But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and
   they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And
   for the rest of your life, you will say "Yes, that's where I was
   supposed to go. That's what I had planned."


   And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because
   the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.

   But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to
   Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely
   things ... about Holland.

   I have heard both of those before.  The trip to Italy can also be
   applied to having a autistic child and if you change the word diabetes
   to autism in the first one it would work too.

   I hope you don't mind.  But how autistic is your son?  I have two
   autistic boys.  My oldest Avion is moderate to server.  We still have
   commutation problems but he is a great kid and has surprised everyone
   with doing more than they thought he would ever do.  And the best part
   is that he is only 9 and still growing and wanting to learning.  Zidan
   is my mildly autistic child and he has the diabetes too (plus a motor
   tic).  Right now we are relearning to dress ourselves at the age of 6
   1/2. He lost this skill when we had to move back in November.  He wants
   nothing to do with diabetes and get mad at me if I even ask him to
   bring me his supplies.  It has been very frustrating with no Endo who
   knows or understands autism.  It is not like I'm trying to get them to
   do therapy with him. I just want them to understand that we have other
   issues besides diabetes.  When I tell them he is autistic, the doctor
   looks at me like I have horns growing out of my head.  And then they
   get mad because Zidan doesn't eat lots of different foods or from all
   the food groups.  But we are working on it and this will not correct
   its self over night or with a shopping trip.
