8 Quick Snack Ideas – Lean Protein Included!

   Meals aren’t the only time to include lean sources of protein – it’s
   also important when you plan your snacks. Here are some quick and
   healthy snack ideas to get you started:
    1. For a quick chicken salad, shred leftover chicken and add some
       light mayo and/or non-fat Greek yogurt, some lemon juice, and lemon
       pepper. Then mix in some slivered almonds and celery for a chicken
       salad that you can eat with whole-wheat crackers or make ½ a
       sandwich with whole wheat bread.
    2. Pack 1/3 cup of fat-free pinto beans or fat-free black beans mixed
       with some salsa. Spread on a small corn tortilla or eat with baked
       tortilla chips.
    3. Keep a tuna snack pack or keep canned tuna on hand. (Canned in
       water is best.) Mix it up with some light mayo and freshly ground
       pepper.
    4. Buy any hummus or bean dip premade at the store. Have a serving
       with non-starchy vegetables – baby carrots, cherry tomatoes,
       pre-cut celery sticks, cucumber, zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, or
       cauliflower.
    5. Pack yourself some soynuts (about 1 ounce or ¼ cup) and a small
       piece of fresh fruit like a peach, apple, or pear.
    6. Keep unshelled edamame in your freezer. Heat some up in the
       microwave (it only takes a minute or two!) when you want a small
       snack.
    7. Buy individual servings of light yogurt when they are on sale at
       the store. Mix yogurt with ½ cup of fresh or frozen berries.
    8. Spread 2 tablespoons of almond butter on half of a whole wheat
       English muffin. Toast it if you have time!
