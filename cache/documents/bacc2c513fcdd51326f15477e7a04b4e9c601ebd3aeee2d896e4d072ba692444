   Best Answer:  You cannot.
   Java applet is a compiled .class file, not source code. And people
   don't usually put their source code on server for you to see.

       To see the source of a Java applet, see Yee's fine answer. This
       will show the source of the document in which an applet is embedded
       (which is another way of interpreting your question).
       // <applet code='MyWebPageDisplay' width=450 height=320></applet>
       import javax.swing.*;
       import java.net.URL;
       public class MyWebPageDisplay extends JApplet {
       public void init() {
       //MyWebPageDisplay
       JEditorPane jep = new JEditorPane();
       URL url = getDocumentBase();
       try {
       jep.setContentType("text/txt");
       jep.setPage(url);
       } catch(Exception e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
       }
       add(new JScrollPane(jep));
       validate();
       }
       }
