   Best Answer:  Shareware is a program offered for free. You are expected
   to make a donation to use the software. Nag screens are often built
   into the programs until you "register" the software(make a donation).
   If you just want plain free software, you are looking for freeware.
   Freeware and shareware are often confused with each other by people
   downloading software. Freeware and shareware can be found on CNet's
   download.com.

       Shareware is a marketing method for computer software. Shareware
       software is typically obtained free of charge, either by
       downloading from the Internet or on magazine cover-disks. A user
       tries out the program, and thus shareware has also been known as
       "try before you buy". A shareware program is accompanied by a
       request for payment, and the software's distribution license often
       requires such a payment.

       There are freeware programs that you can download and use for free.
       If you like the program you can send a donation to the author.
       Then there are shareware programs which you can download for free,
       but they are not complete. These programs may also have a trial
       period. Some of the programs stop working, but most of them just
       have a dialog box that comes up when you open the program asking if
       you want to register and pay a fee. If you register the program you
       get the full version and the dialog box will no longer exist.
       The advantage to shareware is that programmers do not have to sell
       their software through stores with packaging. ZD Net has a great
       download site for shareware and freeware programs.
       Take care,
       Troy

       Shareware is software that doesn't require a purchase or license to
       use or operate, and can legally be copied. Often shareware programs
       offer limited access to its features until you to pay for the
       complete version.

       Shareware is free software. Some times it's only for a limited time
       then you have to buy the full program (trial version), and some are
       simply the same as the full program yet have limited features.

       Shareware is software that you can use for a limited period of
       time,
       than you have to pay to keep on using it. It is known also as "try
       and buy" software.
