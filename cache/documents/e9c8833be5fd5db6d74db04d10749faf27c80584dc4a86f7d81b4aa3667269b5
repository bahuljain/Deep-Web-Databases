Is Your Metabolism Working Against You? 6 Simple Ways to Boost It

   Throughout my years counseling [99]clients I’ve seen many achieve
   fantastic weight loss results, including those who had not had success
   with other approaches, or thought they couldn’t possibly lose weight
   due to various circumstances, like being injured and unable to
   exercise, or being post-menopausal.

   Based on my experience, I always believe that results are possible, but
   I’ve also learned that weight loss isn’t predictable or easy—and it
   certainly isn’t as simple as a calories in versus calories out
   equation.  A new study, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
   illustrated this, and backs what I’ve seen in my own practice—one
   person’s metabolic response to eating less may not mimic another’s, due
   to biological differences.

   NIH researchers studied a dozen obese men and women in a metabolic
   unit. The study measured the subjects’ calorie expenditures, both
   before and after a day of fasting, followed by a six-week phase during
   which they reduced their calorie intakes by 50%. After accounting for
   factors including age, sex, and starting weight, scientists found that
   those who [100]lost the least weight during the reduced calorie period
   were those whose metabolisms decreased most during the one day fast.
   These people have what scientists refer to as a “thrifty” metabolism.
   The opposite results were also found: those with “spendthrift”
   metabolisms, which decreased the least during the fast, lost the most
   weight.

   In a nutshell, the theory behind “thrifty” metabolism is that when
   faced with a sudden shortfall of food, some people’s bodies quickly
   compensate to conserve energy, by burning fewer calories. So if, for
   example, you went from eating 3,000 calories a day to 1,500, a thrifty
   metabolism would trigger a conservation mode, designed to shrink the
   calorie deficit. Historically, people with this adaptation were better
   able to survive during times of famine; but today, it presents a
   challenge for those trying to shed excess pounds. It’s also one of the
   reasons why simply slashing your intake by 500 calories a day isn’t a
   guarantee that you’ll shed one pound in a week (for more check out my
   previous post [101]Why You Can’t Rely on Calorie Counts and [102]Why
   Dieting Makes You Fat).

   If you think you may be in this group, and your biology is making it
   tough for you to see results, don’t give up. Here are six things you
   can do to maximize your metabolism, and counter the effects of possible
   “thriftiness.” While your results may be slower than a “spendthrift”
   counterpart, losing weight isn’t an impossibility.

Become a tea drinker

   Natural substances in green tea—antioxidants called catechins, and
   caffeine—have been shown to help [103]boost metabolism, and trigger
   increased fat burning. Aim for about five cups a day, the amount tied
   to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including [104]heart disease.
   Based on the research on how green tea impacts [105]metabolism, this
   quantity could also translate into the loss of eight pounds over a
   year’s time.

Drink more water

   In addition to naturally curbing calorie intake, water has been shown
   to positively affect metabolism. One German study found that drinking
   two cups (16 ounces) of water [107]upped calorie burning by 30% within
   10 minutes, and the effect was sustained for more than an hour. Shoot
   for a solid eight cups (64 ounces) daily, and if you dislike the taste,
   spruce it up with healthy add-ins like sliced cucumber, fresh grated
   ginger, mashed fruit, lemon, lime, basil, or mint.

Eat more produce

   We all know that veggies and fruits are nutrient rich, but research
   shows they may also impact leanness, due to their ability to help
   preserve metabolism-boosting muscle. In one study, University of
   Florida researchers found that when two groups consumed the same number
   of daily calories, those who [109]ate more plant-based foods had
   smaller waist circumferences, and lower body fat percentages. Aim to
   eat produce at every meal. One simple formula is to include one serving
   of fruit in every breakfast and snack, and two serving of veggies in
   each lunch and dinner. For more about how to build meals around veggies
   check out my previous post [110]5 Perfect Pasta Alternatives.

Eat more whole versus processed foods

   More proof that a calorie isn’t a calorie came from research conducted
   at [112]Pomona College. Researchers found that when healthy women
   consumed meals that were similar in terms of carb, protein, and fat
   content, they [113]burned about 50% more calories eating whole foods
   versus highly processed foods. To reap this metabolism-boosting
   benefit, stick with foods as close to their natural state as possible.
   For example, rather than a turkey sub on a processed roll and a bag of
   baked chips for lunch, order a chopped salad made with greens and
   veggies, topped with lean protein and avocado. At snack time trade
   anything that comes from a package with a tennis ball sized portion of
   fresh fruit and a golf ball sized serving of nuts.

   RELATED: [114]20 Snacks That Burn Fat

Eat more pulses

   You know about beans—black, red, white…well, pulses are a unique food
   group that includes beans, as well as peas, like chickpeas, and split
   peas, and lentils. I made a daily dose of pulses a key strategy in the
   weight loss plan in my new book [115]Slim Down Now, in part because
   they’re so filling, nutrient rich, and gluten free, but also because of
   their impact on metabolism. A review published in the British Journal
   of Nutrition concluded that pulses increase calorie and fat burning,
   and [116]help reduce visceral fat, the deep internal belly fat known to
   up the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. To bolster your
   metabolism, include a half cup of a pulse in one of your daily meals,
   like a side of black beans with your veggie avocado omelet, lentils in
   your lunch salad, oven-roasted chickpeas or hummus in a snack, or
   [117]white bean and kale soup at dinner. You can even incorporate
   pulses into [118]desserts! For more about pulses check out [119]How to
   Keep the Carbs and Still Lose the Pounds.

Drink coffee pre-exercise

   Exercise itself can help boost metabolism, but according to a study
   published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise
   Metabolism drinking java before you get your heart rate up may further
   up your metabolic rate. Researchers found that compared to those who
   took in a placebo, athletes who consumed caffeine pre-exercise
   [121]torched about 15% more calories for three hours post-exercise. The
   dose used in the study was 4.5 mg of caffeine per kilogram of body
   weight. That’s about 300 mg of caffeine for a 150-pound woman (68 kg),
   the amount in about 12 ounces of brewed coffee. For more about the
   benefits of coffee for exercisers, check out my previous [122]post.
