[111]How do you know if diabetes was caught early?
       I hear people say they have been able to almost reverse diabetes if
       caught early. What does that mean? What is the range of fasting
       blood sugar that would suggest it was "caught early"? I found out
       when my fasting blood sugar was 220.

       Best answer: Every person has a unique medical and HEREDITY

       different results because of their personal biology and hereditary

       issues. It is highly possible that you have a stronger diabetic

       to be progressively worsening while his is maintaining and even
       improving.
       Diabetes is progressive, but the SPEED at which it progresses is
       very different for each person.

       underactive thyroid which I now take tablets for. Recently,
       however, I have been feeling exhausted all the time even though I
       have been having early nights. I have also been very hungry and
       snacking between meals which is very unlikely as I usually like my
       3 meals a day and i m done. A friend of mine has diabetes and told
       me I should get tested but I feel a bit of a hypochondriac going
       back again even though I ve already been tested once

       day I tried to eat some candy but I couldn t stop eating candy, and
       I basically ate like a bunch of chocolates and some butterfingers
       for breakfast(I have a weird craving for chocolate). And I was too
       full to eat anything for breakfast and lunch. Just to be clear, I
       do NOT have diabetes type 1, I have a family history, my brother,
       older cousin and great uncle had diabetes type 1. And my parents
       were and still are really over protective of me and my brother
       especially after he was diagnosed. They took my candy and won t
       give it back. And my mother was crying because she thinks I m gonna
       get diabetes and I keep telling him I m fine but she gets really
       scared sometimes. Am i going to be okay?

[131]How much chocolate do i have to eat to get diabetes?
       Best answer: You could eat all the sh!t you want and never become
       diabetic. Usually someone who is overweight and has a poor diet can
       get type 2 diabetes, more so if it's already in the family. No
       amount of chocolate or any other sugary foods will cause you to
       become a type 1.
