   IN BRIEF

   Six million U.S. hospitalizations per year are accompanied by
   hyperglycemia. The degree of hyperglycemia may be an important
   predictor of morbidity and mortality among patients with myocardial
   infarction or stroke and those undergoing surgical procedures,
   including coronary artery bypass. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively
   controlled from the time of admission regardless of patients' primary
   medical problem or previous diabetes status. New methodologies for
   identifying, monitoring, and treating hyperglycemia are needed.

   The data on the importance of controlling glucose in hospital settings
   spans diverse disciplines of medicine. Studies in the areas of stroke,
   myocardial infarction (MI), bypass surgery, and wound and nosocomial
   infections all point to the tremendous potential to reduce morbidity
   and mortality among hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia. It is
   essential to identify hyperglycemia at the time of hospital admission
   and to implement therapy to achieve and maintain glucose levels as
   close to normal as possible, regardless of a patient's primary reason
   for admission or previous diabetes status.

   In the United States, there are more than 4.2 million hospitalizations
   annually among people with diabetes.^1 Additionally, as many as 1.5
   million hospitalized individuals have significant hyperglycemia but no
   history of diabetes.^2 Identification of and therapeutic interventions
   to treat hyperglycemia must be initiated in tandem with treatment of
   the presenting medical problem rather than days after admission when
   many of the acute issues have been addressed. The data presented
   strongly suggest that an early and aggressive approach to the
   management of hyperglycemia may reduce mortality, morbidity, excessive
   hospital stays, and added costs.

   Why is hyperglycemia so easy to overlook?
   Hyperglycemia is often overlooked when a hospitalized patient is
   acutely ill and facing a life-threatening illness. Commonly, a patient
   is admitted with an acute MI or cerebrovascular accident and is
   coincidentally found to have an elevated admission glucose value.
   Often, such patients have no history of glucose intolerance.

   Physicians routinely discontinue their patients' outpatient diabetes
   care regimen and initiate sliding scale insulin coverage.^3 Many
   physicians erroneously consider this practice the standard of care.
   Concerns about precipitating hypoglycemia may limit more aggressive
   strategies for managing hyperglycemia, particularly when patients are
   not tolerating regular meals or when their intake is being limited for
   any of a variety reasons, including pending surgical procedures or
   diagnostic tests.

   Despite the ease and high frequency of use, sliding scale insulin
   coverage often results in a deterioration rather than an improvement in
   glycemic control.^3 Concerns about hypoglycemia are warranted. However,
   hyperglycemia, regardless of whether a previous diabetes diagnosis has
   been made, may pose even greater risks by reducing hospital survival
   rates among patients admitted with stroke or MI.^4-6

   Is hyperglycemia caused by stress or diabetes? It doesn't matter; treat
   it.
   There are no unique diagnostic criteria that account for stress in
   acutely ill patients, nor are there recommendations for making a
   definitive diagnosis of diabetes in the hospital. There is a
   well-defined pathophysiology of the effects of intercurrent illness and
   surgery on carbohydrate metabolism, which may lead to hyperglycemia.
   However, many studies have also demonstrated that stress may result in
   diminished glucose values.^7-20 This reduction in glucose levels during
   times of stress is frequently attributed to insufficient administration
   of exogenous glucose.

   Among hospitalized patients with acute MI, an admission glucose value
   of >180 mg/dl predicted undiagnosed diabetes rather than stress
   hyperglycemia in a study in which newly recognized hyperglycemic
   individuals had subsequent glucose tolerance testing performed 2 months
   after hospital discharge.^4,5 The Diabetes Insulin-Glucose in Acute
   Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) trial demonstrated significant
   reductions in mortality when an intensive insulin regimen was
   administered to hyperglycemic patients hospitalized with acute MI.^4,5
   Enrollment in the DIGAMI study included all patients with glucose
   values >198 mg/dl without regard to previous diabetes status. Nearly
   15% of the study population did not have a history of glucose
   intolerance.

   Is the hospital really the time to consider diabetes? Yes, if the
   diagnosis is missed, the risk for death increases.
   Mortality rates among patients with diabetes are known to be
   significantly higher than those of nondiabetic individuals.^21 The
   Whitehall Study reported a mortality rate of 12 per 1,000 person-years
   for nondiabetic individuals, 40 per 1,000 person-years for those with
   undiagnosed diabetes, and 27 per 1,000 person years for people with
   diagnosed diabetes.^22 The Paris Prospective Study demonstrated
   comparable findings when comparing the mortality rates among patients
   with undiagnosed diabetes (23%) with those with a definitive diagnosis
   of diabetes (20%), while patients without diabetes had a 9% mortality
   rate.^23 In both studies, 6070% of the deaths were attributed to
   cardiovascular disease (Figure 1).^21

   Where is the best place to find unrecognized diabetes? In the hospital.
   Approximately 5.3 million Americans have undiagnosed diabetes. As many
   as one-third of the patients who have significant hyperglycemia during
   their hospital admission do not have any diabetes history.^2 Given the
   7- to 10-year delay between the onset of diabetes and the time of
   diagnosis, there is a high likelihood that patients exhibiting
   hyperglycemia without a history of glucose intolerance may have
   unrecognized diabetes.^20 The beneficial impact of interventions that
   improve hyperglycemia is based on the presence of diabetes, regardless
   of whether a physician has made the diabetes diagnosis.

   When high glucose levels are present, assume that the patient has
   diabetes, and initiate treatment to control the glucose levels to as
   close to normal as possible. Further evaluation of the patient's
   diabetes status can occur following hospitalization. However, failure
   to address and treat the hyperglycemia represents a missed opportunity
   not only to reduce hospital morbidity and mortality, but also to
   initiate interventions that may delay the long-term complications of
   this disease.

   What if the hyperglycemia is caused by medication? Treat it like
   diabetes.
   Often, medications such as steroids and thiazide diuretics, which have
   been associated with worsening glycemic control, are required for
   patients with diabetes. Dozens of medications have been described as
   inducing diabetes, yet there has been little documented about the
   glycemic status of these patients before the initiation of the
   offending drugs.

   Decades ago, corticosteroids were studied as a means of unmasking
   impaired glucose tolerance.^24 Only 3% of normal control subjects had
   positive glucose tolerance tests when pretreated with corticosteroids.
   Other studies among corticosteroid-treated individuals have found that
   <20% of steroid-treated individuals develop diabetes.

   This indicates that hyperglycemia in hospital settings should be
   assumed to be diabetes.^25,26 When medications that potentially produce
   hyperglycemia are required to treat another medical problem, treatment
   of hyperglycemia should be initiated.

   Is there a diagnostic role for hemoglobin A[1c]? Maybe.
   Many clinicians have advocated the use of hemoglobin A[1c] (HbA[1c]) in
   the diagnosis of diabetes.^27-30 Although an elevated HbA[1c ]collected
   when hyperglycemia is first noted can help determine that the
   hyperglycemia existed before hospitalization, a normal HbA[1c] value
   does not preclude the diagnosis of diabetes. Normal HbA[1c] values
   measured during hospital admission did not exclude the diagnosis of
   diabetes when glucose tolerance testing was performed following
   discharge.^31

   As more laboratories begin using the standardized methodologies for
   performing HbA[1c] testing as established by the National
   Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP), it will be easier to
   establish norms and ranges for HbA[1c] and enhance the ability to
   develop guidelines for the diagnosis of diabetes based on elevated
   HbA[1c] values. Laboratories certified by the NGSP all have equivalent
   HbA[1c] assays and can be compared nationally regardless of the
   location or the specific laboratory performing the test. Normal HbA[1c]
   values in the hospital will not preclude the diagnosis of diabetes, and
   such patients will need further follow-up to evaluate diabetes status.

   Diabetes isn't the reason for admission, so why treat? Hyperglycemia
   does affect the primary medical problem.
   Ninety percent of hospitalizations among patients with a known
   diagnosis of diabetes are for reasons other than diabetes.
   Approximately 75% of hospital admissions for people with diabetes are
   attributable to cardiovascular disease.^32 When hyperglycemia is not
   addressed until after the presenting medical problems have been
   treated, the length of hospital stay can be significantly longer than
   that of nondiabetic patients with similar diagnoses. When the diabetes
   is addressed along with other acute problems, not only are there
   improved outcomes, but also potentially shorter hospital stays.^33

   Do transient rises in glucose really matter? Modest glucose elevations
   can worsen inpatient outcomes.
   For the past 50 years, researchers have been evaluating the impact of
   glucose on immune biology. In 1964, Bybee and Roberts reported
   impairment of phagocytic function in white blood cells from patients
   with diabetes.^34

   For several decades, the cellular mechanisms through which glucose
   affects immune function and vascular biology have been explored. Short
   and transient periods of hyperglycemia have resulted in abnormalities
   in granulocyte adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterocidal
   function.^35-41 These impairments in immune function have been
   associated with an increased risk for wound and nosocomial infections.
   Acute hyperglycemia also results in adverse consequences on volume
   status and electrolyte imbalances, which further potentiate poor wound
   healing and can increase the risk for infections.^35-41

   The well-documented studies demonstrating the deleterious short-term
   effects of hyperglycemia ultimately led to two landmark studies: the
   Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom
   Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), both of which demonstrated the
   long-term benefits of glycemic control. The DCCT found that a 1%
   reduction in HbA[1c] could result in as much as a 45% risk reduction in
   the development of serious retinopathy. Comparable reductions in the
   risk were demonstrated for nephropathy and neuropathy. The UKPDS
   reported that a 1% reduction in HbA[1c] resulted in a 25% reduction in
   all-cause diabetes-related mortality among a large population of newly
   diagnosed type 2 patients.

   The Inpatient Data
   Inpatient studies have been designed to evaluate the impact of
   potentially correcting the pathophysiological changes that accompany
   hyperglycemia. Studies among patients with stroke, MI, and those
   undergoing bypass surgery suggest that treatment of hyperglycemia can
   potentially affect morbidity and mortality, and similar benefits may
   apply to controlling hyperglycemia regardless of whether patients have
   a prior diagnosis of diabetes (Table 1).

   Myocardial infarction
   Diabetes is an independent risk marker for morbidity and mortality
   among patients who have suffered an MI.^4,5,42-45 Soler and Frank
   observed that patients with the highest glucose values after an acute
   MI also had the highest mortality rates.^42

   The DIGAMI study underscores the importance of early and aggressive
   interventions designed to bring glucose levels into the normal range
   regardless of a patient's prior diabetes status.^4,5 This large,
   randomized prospective trial enrolled 660 patients with admission
   glucose values of >198 mg/dl. Hyperglycemic individuals were randomized
   to receive either conventional diabetes care or intravenous insulin
   followed by four insulin injections of daily.

   One year after admission, there was a 30% reduction in mortality among
   the intervention patients. The greatest benefits from intensive insulin
   therapy were seen in the subgroup of patients without a history of
   diabetes, who had a 58% risk reduction in hospital mortality and a 52%
   risk reduction in mortality when followed for 1 year compared to
   conventionally treated patients.

   When outcomes were tracked for a mean of 3.4 years, intervention
   patients had 25% lower death rates. The DIGAMI study demonstrated that
   for every nine patients receiving intensive glucose control, one life
   was saved.

   Stroke
   Epidemiological data have demonstrated an increased risk of stroke
   among patients with diabetes.^46-59 The Framingham Study found that the
   incidence of stroke was 2.5 times higher in diabetic men and 3.6 times
   higher in diabetic women than in those without diabetes.^6 Several
   studies have suggested that hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor
   influencing stroke severity. Hyperglycemia in nondiabetic individuals
   with stroke has also been associated with increased mortality.^60

   Although many studies suggest that normalizing glucose may improve
   stroke outcomes among patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia,
   randomized trials such as DIGAMI have not been conducted among stroke
   patients. In a prospective analysis, Pulsinelli et al. reported that
   both patients with diabetes and hyperglycemic patients without an
   established diagnosis of diabetes had worse neurological outcomes than
   those who were normoglycemic.^53 Stroke-related deficits were more
   severe when the admission glucose values were >120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/l).
   Only 43% of the patients with an admission glucose value of >120 mg/dl
   were able to return to work, whereas 76% of patients with lower glucose
   values regained employment.

    Figure 2. Bar graph shows plasma glucose on admission in relation to
    mortality in nondiabetic stroke patients. From ref. 6. Reprinted with

   Jorgenson et al. evaluated the relationship between plasma glucose and
   mortality rates among 233 diabetic patients hospitalized with an acute
   stroke. Diabetes was an independent risk factor that doubled the
   mortality rate.^6 Among 623 hyperglycemic patients who did not have a
   history of diabetes, mortality and initial stroke severity increased
   linearly with increasing admission glucose values >108 mg/dl (Figure
   2).

   Weir and colleagues found that a plasma glucose >144 mg/dl within the
   first 24 hours of admission was a risk factor independent of age,
   stroke type, and stroke severity and predicted double the mortality
   risk.^56 Similar findings by Asplund et al. demonstrated that the
   presence of diabetes adversely affected short- and long-term
   neurological outcomes among patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic
   strokes.^60

   Other studies have found that admission glucose levels and/or HbA[1c]
   values correlate to stroke size, clinical severity, and prognosis, and
   a similar relationship between glucose levels and outcomes applies to
   hyperglycemic, nondiabetic individuals with hyperglycemia.^48-50

   Coronary Artery Bypass and General Surgery
   Several studies and data from the National Cardiac Surgery Database
   (NCSD) have documented an increased operative mortality and
   postoperative mortality among patients with diabetes.^61-68 Herlitz et
   al. reported that the diabetic mortality rate within the 30 days
   following bypass surgery was 6.7% compared to 3.0% in nondiabetic
   subjects.^61 Weintraub et al. reported an in-hospital mortality rate of
   5.4% among 279 diabetic patients undergoing angioplasty compared to no
   deaths among the 610 nondiabetic patients undergoing angioplasty during
   the same time period.^62 The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization
   Investigation (BARI) reported that surgically treated diabetic patients
   had lower 5-year survival rates compared to nondiabetic patients (80.6%
   vs. 91.4%).^63

   Multiple factors have been implicated as possible mechanisms
   contributing to poorer outcomes, including suboptimal perioperative
   glucose control, which increases fatty acid metabolism, compromises
   glycolysis in muscle, and impairs platelet and fibrinolytic function.
   These factors predispose hyperglycemic patients to infection and
   impaired wound healing. Therapies to improve glycemic control have
   demonstrated the potential benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality
   among patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery.

   Bypass surgery: perioperative control counts. A provocative study by
   Kalin and colleagues evaluated the impact of intravenous insulin
   administered to patients with diabetes before and throughout bypass
   surgery.^69 Outcomes of 400 patients with diabetes were compared to a
   population of 876 nondiabetic patients who underwent bypass and to
   national data from the NCSD during the same time period. Hospital
   mortality was almost identical between the diabetic and nondiabetic
   patients (1.75% vs. 1.71%). During this same time period, the NCSD
   reported nearly a 50% higher mortality (RR 1.46) for patients with
   diabetes compared to nondiabetic patients undergoing bypass. The use of
   intravenous insulin initiated before surgery potentially reduced the
   excess hospital mortality that was observed nationally among patients
   with diabetes undergoing bypass surgery.

   In a smaller study among bypass patients, Marcus et al. optimized
   glucose control through the use of intravenous insulin among diabetic
   patients with glucose levels >120 mg/dl.^70 Medical interventions were
   made to correct other metabolic abnormalities, including elevated
   triglycerides, uric acid, and urine microalbumin. Patients receiving
   these metabolic interventions inclusive of intravenous insulin had a
   significantly lower combined incidence of operative death, MI,
   cerebrovascular accidents, renal failure, and the need for
   intraoperative balloon pump (18% vs. 57%, P < 0.004).

   Perioperative glucose control reduces infections and death.
   Diabetes has been established as an independent risk marker for
   postoperative surgical wound infection and carries with it a 2-5 times
   higher infection rate than nondiabetic populations.^71,72 Additionally,
   medianstinitis following bypass surgery occurs significantly more often
   among patients with diabetes, and hyperglycemia in the immediate
   postoperative period is an independent risk marker for deep sternal
   wound infections.

   Furnary and colleagues prospectively compared the outcomes of patients
   receiving subcutaneous insulin injections to those receiving
   intravenous insulin initiated perioperatively.^73 The incidence of deep
   sternal wounds was 0.8% in the group receiving intravenous insulin
   compared with 2.0% in patients receiving intermittent subcutaneous
   insulin. Additionally, Furnary reported a fivefold increased risk for
   death (3.8% vs. 19%) among the patients who developed deep sternal
   wounds as compared to those who did not develop wounds postoperatively.
   Zerr and colleagues reported that the use of an intravenous insulin
   protocol begun immediately postoperatively resulted in a 60% reduction
   in deep sternal wound infections. Wound infections were best correlated
   to an average blood glucose level of >200 mg/dl on postoperative day
   1^74 (Figure 3).

      fig3.jpg (13074 bytes)
      Figure 3. Postoperative blood glucose at 48 hours predicts wound
      infection (P = 0.002). From ref. 74. Reprinted with permission.

   Golden and colleagues evaluated 411 patients with diabetes who
   underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and tracked the glucose values
   during the 36-hour period following surgery.^75 Postoperative
   hyperglycemia predicted risk for short-term infections and was a risk
   factor independent of age, sex, race, underlying co-morbidity, or
   severity of the underlying illness. Patients with a mean glucose of
   >200 mg/dl were more likely to develop infections than those with
   values <200 mg/dl. (See related article on p. 44.)

   In a randomized study by Rassias et al. testing the effect of an
   insulin infusion on perioperative neutrophil function in diabetic
   patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery, participants (n
   = 26) were randomly assigned to receive either aggressive insulin
   therapy or standard insulin therapy during surgery.^71 Blood was drawn
   for neutrophil testing before surgery, 1 hour after the completion of
   cardiopulmonary bypass, and on the first postoperative day. Neutrophil
   phagocytic activity decreased to 75% of baseline activity in the
   aggressive therapy group and to 47% of baseline activity in the
   standard group (P < 0.05). The authors concluded that continuous
   insulin infusion improves the ability of white cells to function in
   diabetic patients and may increase resistance to infection after
   surgery.

   General surgery and medical patients.
   Pomposelli et al. found that among 97 patients with diabetes undergoing
   surgery, a postoperative day 1 glucose of >220 mg/dl was a sensitive
   predictor of nosocomial infections.^35 Patients with elevated glucose
   values developed infections at a rate 2.7 times higher than did
   patients with glucose values <220 mg/dl. Many of these infections seen
   in the diabetic population were quite severe and included sepsis,
   pneumonia, and wound infections. A separate evaluation that removed
   patients with less severe urinary tract infections from the analysis
   found that the risk for severe infection during the hospitalization
   rose 5.9 times higher for patients with glucose values of >220 mg/dl on
   postoperative day 1.

   Similarly, Korytkowski et al. found that the degree of hyperglycemia on
   admission contributed significantly to length of hospital stay among
   patients admitted with acute medical problems, including pneumonia and
   acute MI.^76

   A New Hospital Paradigm for Glycemic Control Is Needed
   Korytkowski reported that, despite significantly elevated glucose
   levels in the majority of hospitalized patients with diabetes, there is
   no standardized method for controlling glucose.^76 There is a strong
   need to standardize the monitoring and intervention practices for
   hospitalized patients who have diabetes as a secondary medical problem.
   The deleterious consequences of suboptimal glycemic control among
   inpatients have been clearly documented, but few studies have evaluated
   how to implement strategies for achieving better glycemic control.

   Sliding scale coverage does not work.
   Sliding scale regimens have often been considered the standard of care,
   yet few studies have evaluated outcomes between sliding scale insulin
   coverage and other treatment regimens. Queale et al. found that sliding
   scale insulin therapy provided no benefit as compared to a standing
   dose of intermediate-acting insulin, and patients who received sliding
   scale regimens were 3 times more likely to have hyperglycemic
   episodes.^3

   No data have been published demonstrating that the use of sliding scale
   insulin benefits hospitalized patients. Very few studies have directly
   evaluated which is the best modality for treating inpatients with
   hyperglycemia, but numerous papers have pointed out the potential
   deleterious consequences of using sliding scale coverage rather than
   definitive therapy.^3

   Intravenous insulin makes physicians uncomfortable.
   Studies demonstrate the importance of controlling glucose and the
   advantages of intravenous insulin over subcutaneous insulin. Many
   physicians are uncomfortable treating diabetes, and the use of
   intravenous insulin therapy has been limited to intensive care units or
   special care units in which the nursing staff has expertise using
   intravenous insulin infusions.^77

   Despite the trend toward replacing specialty care with primary care,
   patients may fare better when subspecialists are involved in the care
   of acutely ill hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia.^78-80 Not only
   are there improved outcomes resulting from consultations by diabetes
   specialty teams, but studies have also demonstrated the beneficial
   impact of cluster units in which patients with both primary and
   secondary diagnoses of diabetes benefit from care by nurses and other
   medical staff with specialized training in diabetes. Reduced lengths of
   hospital stay have been reported when such units are available to both
   medical and surgical patients.^81

   New technology is near.
   As continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring is now becoming
   available, monitoring of glucose and treatment of hyperglycemia may
   become much easier. This type of monitoring device measures
   interstitial glucose every 5 minutes. It may be an extremely important
   tool for physicians treating hospitalized patients.

   Frequent monitoring can allow for more accurate dosing of insulin and
   can dramatically improve care. The tremendously successful insulin pump
   therapy, which delivers subcutaneous insulin in easily adjustable
   dosages, could potentially be utilized in conjunction with the new
   glucose monitoring technologies and could revolutionize the treatment
   hyperglycemia in the hospital.

   Conclusion
   Today, there are neither systems for the identification of patients
   with hyperglycemia nor standardized protocols for the monitoring and
   treatment of hyperglycemia in hospitals. Subcutaneous sliding scale
   insulin coverage has been a hospital standard despite the fact that
   there is no evidence demonstrating its efficacy, and the medical
   literature suggests that subcutaneous coverage alone may actually be
   detrimental to glycemic control.

   Newer methodologies for earlier identification of patients with
   hyperglycemia coupled with innovative systems for monitoring glucose
   and delivering insulin will help reduce morbidity and mortality among
   the nearly 6 million annual hospitalizations that are accompanied by
   hyperglycemia in the United States.

   The hospital setting provides a unique opportunity to identify patients
   who may have unrecognized diabetes and may be the easiest and best
   place to evaluate and address a patient's diabetes status and develop a
   treatment plan for subsequent outpatient diabetes follow-up and care.
