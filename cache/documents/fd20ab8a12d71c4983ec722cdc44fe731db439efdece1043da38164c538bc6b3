   Football preseason is upon us, and — sports fan or not — here’s one
   reason to care: this photo.

   ‘Who? What? Where?’ is probably coming out of your mouth in sputters,
   so we’ll do our best to answer.

   It’s a duo of Wagyu beef hot dogs wrapped in bacon and topped with
   guacamole and pork rinds, served at Bourbon Steak & Pub on the ground
   level of the new San Francisco 49ers stadium at all home games this
   season, created by Bourbon chef Michael Mina and a culinary team not
   afraid of a little cholesterol.

   Any questions of Why? are trickier to answer, but when it’s football
   season, you don’t question double-barrel hot dogs.

   If you’re eyeing this up and feeling a little down that you won’t be in
   San Francisco this year, never fear. Here’s a look at 4 other
   over-the-top stadium foods that may be more convenient to try:

   Oink oink! The [102]Three Little Pigs nachos at Soldier Field, home to
   the Chicago Bears, are made with pork rinds instead of chips and coated
   in a pepper jack cheese sauce. On top: the other two pigs (pulled pork
   and bacon bits), plus jalapeño for good measure. Order a tray at
   [103]Aramark nacho stations in sections 110 and 440.

   Primanti Brothers sandwich shop is a Pittsburgh tradition, so of course
   you can find one at Heinz Field, where the Steelers play. The
   [105]signature sandwich is piled with meat (usually salami, turkey or
   roast beef), then stacked even higher with French fries and slaw.

   Paesano’s — a South Philadelphia favorite with a location at Lincoln
   Financial Field — serves Eagles fans the [106]hoagie to trump all
   hoagies: beef brisket, horseradish mayo, Provolone cheese and an oozy
   fried egg. It’s pretty much impossible to eat this one without spilling
   on your jersey, but it’s worth it.

   We’ve seen [107]bacon on top of apple pie, so why not bacon in an apple
   pie milkshake? [108]This beauty is from chef [109]Michael Symon, who
   runs restaurant The B Spot at Browns Stadium in Cleveland. Warning:
   Since the restaurant’s on the club level, you may need to shell out
   some serious cash on tickets to slurp this shake. We recommend making
   wealthy friends.
