       Stroke Patients
       By Dennis ThompsonHealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Nov. 3, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Extracting a stroke-causing blood clot is better
       than just using a clot-busting drug for preserving brain function,
       a new analysis concludes. About 45 percent of patients who
       underwent the clot-removal procedure experienced functional
       independence at 90 days, compared with about 32 percent of patients

       By Randy DotingaHealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Sept. 22, 2015
       (HealthDay News) — Most people who’ve survived a cardiac arrest in
       the hospital don’t have “do not resuscitate” (DNR) orders, even if
       they have a poor prognosis, a new study reports. Fewer than one in
