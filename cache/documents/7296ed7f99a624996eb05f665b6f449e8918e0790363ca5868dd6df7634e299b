   Best Answer:  its quite easy danny to install your new graphic card
   first you need to uninstall your previous drivers from add/remove
   programs in control panel,if its onboard you may find the drivers may
   be part of a chipset driver program/installation so when uninstalling
   your video/graphic driver make sure you dont uninstall your
   audio/ide/lan or usb2.0 drivers by mistake
   once you have uninstalled your graphic card drivers then turn off your
   p.c.lay it on its side and open up the case
   depending on the type of interface you have(agp or pci-express),locate
   the slot and then take your new card from its packaging and hold it by
   its side(do not directly hold the circuit board of the card,this may
   damage the card)
   if its agp then gently inset the card into the appropriate slot,making
   sure the white retaining clip locks into place at the end.the
   pci-express card slots in pretty much the same but the slots are
   different
   making sure again thats everything is correctly inserted and the card
   is screwed/clamped in properly then close the p.c case and switch it
   back on
   as soon as windows loads it will say"found new hardware"ignore this and
   when any windows appear just cancel them
   instead of using the drivers that came with the card you are better
   getting up to date drivers from
   [120]http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html
   download the appropriate driver and burn it to disk(you can install it
   directly from your hard drive though),then just click on the ati ccc
   driver installation icon
   note:ati radeon drivers require dot net framework for installation,you
   can get this from the ati driver website link above or from
   [121]http://www.microsoft.com/net/
   once you have installed the ati radeon drivers a restart is
   required,after this your monitor may need adjusting(resolution and
   refresh rate) and the screen may flicker or go black for a few
   seconds,dont worry this is normal
   and thats it,well done,every now and again check the driver website for
   more up to date drivers,i personally add the website to "my
   favourites"so i can easily access the website
   any problems danny let me know mate
   good luck!

       First make sure your pc can run the card. That means checking the
       power supply,monitor type, and the card slots of your motherboard.
       Once you have done, turn off your pc and insert the card into the
       correct slot (Pci/e or agp). Your graphics card should come with
       the drivers you need to run it :/. if you take the side off your pc
       and look at the box in the top left corner of your pc, it should
       show you the max power output on a sticker or something. That's the
       way it's on my pc. But for the most part just plug in the card
       carefully and turn on the pc and see what happens.

       You will first need to disable your onboard graphics by rebooting
       to the CMOS or setup screen. You will see an option to disable
       onboard graphics. There's really no need to disable drivers first
       because when you install the new one, those drivers will be used.
