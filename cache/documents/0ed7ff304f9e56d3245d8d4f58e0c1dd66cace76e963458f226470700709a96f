   Have you hopped on the almond milk bandwagon? Whether you’re trying to
   [99]avoid dairy or you’re looking to incorporate more
   [100]heart-healthy nuts into your diet, nut milks are an easy and tasty
   way to go.

   But if you check out the labels on many store-bought brands, you’ll
   often find sugar, stabilizers, and other additives—yuck. Plus, packaged
   nut milks can get pricey.

   RELATED: [101]Best and Worst Nuts for Your Health

   So, why not make your own? Almond milk is great to start with because
   almonds are easy to find and familiar-tasting. Not only is it
   surprisingly easy, but if a store near you sells bulk nuts, you can
   save a bundle. All you need are nuts, water, a blender, and some
   cheesecloth.

   Here’s how to make it:

   1. Soak the nuts. Start with 1 cup of raw, unsalted nuts. Place the
   nuts in a bowl and cover with at least 1 inch of cool, fresh water
   (filtered is best). Make sure your bowl has some space, as the nuts
   will plump up a bit. Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate for at
   least 4 hours, or overnight.

   2. Place a piece of cheesecloth over a jar or other container, securing
   it with a rubber band.

   3. Drain the nuts in a colander and rinse thoroughly with cool water.
   Toss them in a blender. Add 1 ½ cups of cool water and a pinch of salt
   (optional). If you want to sweeten the milk, you can add a couple of
   pitted dried dates to the mix, or a tablespoon or two of maple syrup or
   honey. Blend at the highest speed for about 2 minutes—you want those
   nuts thoroughly pulverized. Blend in up to ½ cup more water, a few
   tablespoons at a time, to thin it if desired. Taste the milk and add
   more sweetener or salt, if needed. You also can blend in some vanilla,
   if you like.

   4. Slowly pour the milk into the jar, through the cheesecloth. Work
   slowly so it can pass through the cheesecloth and not overflow. When
   all of the milk is through, gather up the cheesecloth and squeeze to
   extract as much liquid as possible. Cover the jar and chill. Makes
   about 2 to 3 cups.

   Here are 5 more tips for making nut milk at home:

   Start experimenting

   You can use just about any kind of nut in this recipe. [103]Cashews are
   especially easy because they’re soft, so you don’t even have to strain
   the milk.

   Save the leftover pulp

   You can add it to pancake or muffin batter or cookie dough, sprinkle it
   into oatmeal, or toast it along with the rice to add protein to a
   pilaf. Or spread it out on a baking sheet, turn your oven onto its
   lowest setting and bake the pulp until it’s dry, let cool, then pulse
   in a food processor until it’s finely ground. Now you have nut meal—use
   it in place of some of the flour in recipes or in place of breadcrumbs.
   Store it in a plastic baggie in the freezer.

   Jazz it up

   To flavor the milk, blend in some unsweetened cocoa powder (you may
   need a little extra sweetener for this) or spices like cinnamon or
   pumpkin pie spice. You could even dissolve some instant coffee granules
   in vanilla and add that.

   Use it early and often

   Enjoy your nut milk in a few days, or it will spoil. Use it anywhere
   you’d enjoy dairy milk—in coffee, over cereal, in smoothies, even in
   baking recipes. And the nut milk will separate, but don’t worry: Just
   shake well before using it and it will come right back together.

   Make life easier

   If you’re going to make nut milk often, think about investing in a nut
   milk bag ($10; [104]rawnutmilkbag.com). It’s easier to use than
   cheesecloth (it has an adjustable top so it’s easy to secure over a
   jar), and greener, too, since it’s reusable.
