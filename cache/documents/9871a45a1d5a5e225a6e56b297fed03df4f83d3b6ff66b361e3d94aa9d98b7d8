New Drug Lowers Cholesterol Beyond What Statins Can Do, Study Finds

   By Steven Reinberg
   HealthDay Reporter

   SUNDAY, March 30, 2014 (HealthDay News) — Two studies find that an
   experimental cholesterol-lowering drug is effective when combined with
   statins and beats another add-on drug when it comes to helping
   hard-to-treat patients.

   The drug, evolocumab, is an injectable antibody that works differently
   than statins by increasing the ability of the liver to clear LDL
   (“bad”) cholesterol from the blood. The value of this drug is that it
   lowers cholesterol in patients who cannot tolerate statins or for whom
   statins don’t lower cholesterol enough.

   “These two new studies provide further evidence of the efficacy of
   evolocumab for lowering LDL cholesterol in statin-treated and in
   statin-intolerant patients. The results are impressive,” said Dr. Gregg
   Fonarow, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Los
   Angeles, who had no part in either study.

   Both studies were funded by Amgen, the maker of evolocumab, and the
   results were scheduled to be presented Sunday at the American College
   of Cardiology’s annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.

   “Evolocumab may provide an effective option for patients needing
   additional LDL-cholesterol lowering,” said Dr. Jennifer Robinson,
   director of the Prevention Intervention Center at the University of
   Iowa College of Public Health, and lead author of the first study.

   In that trial, evolocumab was added to statins such as atorvastatin
   (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor). The trial,
   which involved almost 1,900 patients, also compared the effectiveness
   of evolucumab when pitted against ezetimibe (Zetia), another drug that
   can be added to statin therapy to further reduce cholesterol.

   “Evolocumab further reduces LDL cholesterol by about 65 to 75 percent
   when added to a statin. Evolocumab reduces LDL cholesterol more than
   ezetimibe — about a 15 to 20 percent additional LDL-cholesterol
   reduction, when added to statin,” Robinson said.

   “A [different] trial is under way to determine if the addition of
   evolocumab will further reduce heart attack and stroke in
   statin-treated patients with cardiovascular disease,” she added.

   For the second trial, a research team led by Dr. Erik S.G. Stroes,
   chair of the department of vascular medicine at the Academic Medical
   Center in Amsterdam, found that evolocumab was more effective than
   Zetia in lowering cholesterol beyond what could be achieved by statins
   alone.

   The researchers treated 307 patients with evolocumab or the widely used
   Zetia. LDL cholesterol was reduced by up to 56 percent in patients
   using evolocumab. That was almost a 39 percent larger reduction than
   Zetia achieved, he said.

   “We finally seem to have a good alternative treatment for patients who
   experience severe side effects to statin therapy. The combination of a
   robust cholesterol-lowering effect with minimal side effects make
   evolocumab a promising treatment for those patients not tolerating
   statin therapy,” Stroes said.

   Dr. David Friedman, chief of heart failure services at Franklin
   Hospital in Valley Stream, N.Y., said reaching LDL cholesterol-lowering
   goals in high-risk heart patients poses an ongoing challenge.

   Evolocumab holds promise, “however, we need to await more outcome-based
   measures that show an actual reduction in heart attacks and strokes to
   show the true benefit of evolocumab in the long term,” Friedman said.

   Another expert, Dr. Tara Narula, associate director of the cardiac care
   unit at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.

   “We need more research before we can definitively say that this agent
   is safe and effective. We don’t know how simply lowering LDL
   cholesterol translates into overall cardiovascular outcomes,” she said.

   Narula noted that studies of Zetia failed to show a reduction of heart
   attacks and strokes, even though the drug effectively lowered
   cholesterol.

   “We need to await the results of [a different, ongoing trial] to see if
   lowering LDL cholesterol lower than standard levels really does
   translate into reduced cardiovascular events over time. That’s the kind
   of research we need before we change our clinical practice,” she said.

   Studies presented at medical meetings are considered preliminary until
   published in a peer-reviewed journal.
