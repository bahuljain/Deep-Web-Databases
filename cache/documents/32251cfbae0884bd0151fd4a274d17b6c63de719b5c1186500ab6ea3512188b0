   Best Answer:  I'll just assume you already have the value.
   if (exists $hash{$value}) {
   print "You already typed ",$value,"\n";
   }
   else {
   $hash{$value} = 1;
   }

       well, a key and a value are two different things, to find a hash
       tables key see:
       perldoc -f exists (type that on the command line)
       to find a value you can iterate through the hash's values
       perldoc -f values
       also see: perldoc perlfunc
       here is a working example for what you seek, but really perl is
       fun! you should experiment yourself, that is the only way you will
       learn it :)
       #!/usr/bin/perl -w
       use strict;
       use warnings;
       my %hash_table = (
       key1 => 'v',
       key2 => 'z'
       );
       while(my $in = <STDIN>){
       chomp $in;
       print "input: $in\n";
       foreach my $v (values %hash_table){
       print "found it\n" if $v eq $in;
       }
       }
       #outputs:
       $ perl hsh_t.pl
       a <- typed in on keyboard
       input: a
       b <- typed in on keyboard
       input: b
       v <- typed in on keyboard
       input: v
       found it
       r <- typed in on keyboard
       input: r
       z <- typed in on keyboard
       input: z
       found it
       also check out [118]http://perlmonks.org/
