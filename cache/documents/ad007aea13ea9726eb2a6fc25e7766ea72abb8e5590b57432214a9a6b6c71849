   Cancer patients testing drugs on mouse 'avatars' Associated Press
   Monday, December 15, 2014

   Scientists often test drugs in mice. Now some cancer patients are doing
   the same — with the hope of curing their own disease.
   They are paying a private lab to breed mice that carry bits of their
   own tumors so treatments can be tried first on the customized rodents.
   The idea is to see which drugs might work best on a specific person's
   specific cancer.
   The mice may help patients make what can be very hard choices under
   difficult circumstances. Studies can suggest a certain chemotherapy may
   help, but patients wonder whether it will work for them. Often there's
   more than one choice, and if the first one fails, a patient may be too
   sick to try another. So hundreds of people have made "mouse avatars"
   over the last few years to test chemotherapies.
   "What I'm doing is personalized cancer treatment. It's the wave of the
   future," said Eileen Youtie, a Miami woman using mice to guide care for
   her hard-to-treat form of breast cancer. "Part of this is trying to
   eliminate chemos that are not going to work on me. I don't want to
   waste time taking them and poison my body."
   But there are no guarantees the mice will help.
   "There's not a lot of science" to say how well this works, and it
   should be considered highly experimental, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld,
   deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.
   There are some early encouraging reports, he said. One study of 70
   patients found the mice generally reflected how well patients responded
   to various drugs. But there is no evidence that using mice is any
   better than care based on medical guidelines or the gene tests that
   many patients get now to help pick drugs.
   Mouse testing costs $10,000 or more, and insurers don't cover it. It
   takes several months, so patients usually have to start therapy before
   mouse results are in.
   "I do see promise, but it's very time-consuming, it's very expensive.
   For the average patient, standard care is going to be the way to go,"
   said Alana Welm, a cancer researcher at the Oklahoma Medical Research
   Foundation. She gave a talk on mouse avatars last week at the San
   Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. It was the third major cancer meeting
   this year to feature work on customized cancer mice.
   Several labs breed these mice but the main supplier to patients has
   been Champions Oncology, a company based in Hackensack, New Jersey,
   that also operates in London, Tel Aviv and Singapore. About 7,000 mice
   are kept in a Baltimore lab with six rooms that resemble stock rooms of
   a shoe store, with tall shelves that hold row upon row of plastic cages
   labeled with each cancer patient's name.
   Most mice are white-haired females with beady red eyes, but others are
   hairless. Some live alone while others climb over one another and sleep
   in small piles. All have easy access to food and water, and many bear
   signs of the tumor graft — a shaved portion of hair, an incision scar
   and a lump growing off one side.
   Patients have a tumor sample sent to Champions, which charges $1,500 to
   bank it, plus $2,500 for each drug tested in groups of mice implanted
   with bits of the tumor. Most patients try three to five drugs and spend
   $10,000 to $12,000, said Champions' chief medical officer, Dr. Angela
   Davies.
   Youtie spent $30,000 "because I want them to test all the possible
   drugs," even some for other types of cancer.
   That approach helped Yaron Panov, a 59-year-old Toronto man diagnosed
   four years ago with liposarcoma, a soft-tissue cancer. No specific
   drugs were recommended, and "I was given six months to live," he said.
   Tests on his avatar mice suggested the first drug he was prescribed
   would not work but that one for colon cancer might.
   "It was working on the mice so I knew it would work on me," he said.
   "It's such a boost of confidence" and it makes it easier to endure side
   effects, said Panov, whose cancer is in remission.
   Reuven Moser, a 71-year-old man from Tel Aviv, Israel, said his avatar
   mice confirmed that drugs prescribed for colon cancer that had spread
   to his liver were a good option.
   "Most of the time the oncologists want to follow a protocol, but they
   don't know how it will affect the patient," Moser said. "It was very
   reassuring" to see the mice respond, he said. Moser's mice were bred in
   February and he is still undergoing treatment.
   Dr. Andrew Gaya of Leaders in Oncology Care, a private clinic in
   London, helped lead the 70-patient study of avatar mice and gave
   results at a cancer conference in September. It looked back at how well
   mice performed in patients whose outcomes from treatment were already
   known. About 70 percent of the time, tests in the mice suggested
   something that turned out to have helped the patients, he said. And if
   something had not worked in the mice it almost never worked in a
   patient.
   Mice have some drawbacks, said Dr. Benjamin Neel, director of research
   at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto and a spokesman for the
   American Association for Cancer Research.
   The tumor grafts are under the mouse skin — not in places where the
   cancer normally occurs, such as the pancreas or lungs, and therefore
   don't reflect the human tumor's environment. The mice also have highly
   impaired immune systems so they can tolerate the human tumors. That
   means they don't reflect how a person's immune system would respond to
   a treatment and cannot be used to test immunotherapies.
   "Even if it turns out these have real value," they're likely to be
   eclipsed by newer advances, such as ways to grow tumor cells in a lab
   dish that take only a few weeks, he said.
   For now, mice seem the best bet, along with gene testing and her
   doctors' advice, said Youtie, the Miami woman with breast cancer. Her
   mouse testing suggested that either of two drugs would be effective, so
   she chose the one thought to have fewer side effects on the heart. She
   recently finished chemotherapy, is about to finish radiation treatment,
   and said she does not feel guilty about using the mice.
   "Animal abuse? I don't look at it that way," she said. "It's not
   testing cosmetics. It's trying to save my life."
