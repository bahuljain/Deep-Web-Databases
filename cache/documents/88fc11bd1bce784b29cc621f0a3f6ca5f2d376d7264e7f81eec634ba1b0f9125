Ingredients

   2 ripe medium-size bananas
   2 ripe medium-size avocados
   1/3 cup lite coconut milk
   1/3 cup cocoa powder
   1/4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend

Instructions

    1. Add all of the ingredients to a food processor or blender and blend
       until completely smooth, stopping occasionally to scrap the sides
       of the food processor.
    2. If you have a homemade ice cream maker, blend the mixture in the
       ice cream maker for 10 minutes, then pack into a container and
       freeze. If you do not have an ice cream maker, just pack and
       freeze.
    3. To serve, bring the ice cream out of the freezer about 20 minutes
       before serving to slightly thaw so itâ€™s easier to scoop.
