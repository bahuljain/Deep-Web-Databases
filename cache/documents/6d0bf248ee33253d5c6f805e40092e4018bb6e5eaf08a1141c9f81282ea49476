   I saw my doctor yesterday and she put me on Lipitor for high
   cholesterol.  I would like to hear from anyone who has taken this
   medication and what your experiences are, please.


   I'm very wary about starting new medicines because I have a lot of
   adverse drug reactions but I know my cholesterol levels have really
   gotten high in the last couple of years since my diabetes diagnosis.
   My A1C is 5.8 to 6.0  each visit though.


   She also prescribed Synthroid for low thyroid.  I'd lke to know about
   anyone's experiences with this also.  I'm definitely nervous about
   starting these two medications.  Thanks.

   I have taken Synthroid for the last 7 years.  I have been on statins
   for the last 2.


   First of all, because there is a strong connection between low thyroid
   and high cholesterol, I would not recommend starting both medicines at
   once.  I would start the synthroid first, and see what happens to your
   cholesterol levels when your thyroid levels come into line.  Many
   people experience an improvement in their cholesterol numbers when
   their thyroid is properly regulated.


   Synthroid shouldn't cause side effects unless you are taking too much.
    If you are having problems with fatigue, constipation, dry skin--it
   should make these things better.


   Adjusting the medications for thyroid takes weeks to months, depending
   on how far off your levels are.  The cholesterol levels can take some
   time after that to settle.  These may also respond more readily to diet
   and exercise after your thyroid is regulated.


   Keep in mind, the damage from high cholesterol (if you believe that it
   really is the culprit) takes decades to develop.  Waiting several
   months to see what happens to these numbers as your thyroid is
   regulated is not a long time in the scheme of things.


   I took lipitor first (my cholesterol stayed high, well after my thryoid
   numbers were good).  I did well on it for 10 months before I began to
   experience the large muscle pain that they list as a side effect.
   After going off of it for 3 months, I tried crestor instead.  Lipitor
   (and its cousins) is fat soluble, and tends to be stored by the body.
   Crestor (and its cousins) is water soluble and tends not to be stored
   as much.  Patients report fewer muscle problems with the water soluble
   statins, but they don't work as well as the fat soluble type, so the
   net result is that patients often take a higher dose.


   Most of the listed side effects of statins--nausea and GI distress were
   mine--go away with in a couple weeks of starting the medication.


   I would suggest you research and discuss Niacin with your doctor.  Slow
   release niacin is coming back into favor--it was the original
   cholesterol drug before there were statins.  The beauty of it is that
   it lowers your LDL, raises your HDL and lowers your triglycerides.  It
   is a vitamin--so it can be bought with out a prescription--and is much
   less expensive than a statin.  The primary side effect that bothers
   people is "flushing" which many people experience until they are
   acclimated to the drug (basically you turn red all over for about an
   hour, about an hour after you take it).  It generally does not have the
   muscle issues that statins do.  I take niacin as well as crestor.


   I will add that both statins and high dose niacin require monitoring of
   liver and kidney function.  In diabetics and prediabetics they are
   known to raise blood glucose values by a small percentage as well.

   My thyroid has always been good so I have no experience with Synthroid.


   I have taken a statin for close to ten years now. At first it was
   Lipitor, and then later we switched to other generic statins to save
   money. I had no side effects with Lipitor. I thought maybe my leg
   cramps were due to some of the other statins, and switched from one to
   the other various times, and stopped them for a while because of the
   leg cramps, which never went away when I switched or stopped, and never
   increased when I started again. After a while a doctor told me that the
   muscle pain at times discussed as a side-effect of statins, which
   manufacturers say represents a small percentage of those taking the
   drug, actually is a more general ache than the leg cramps I was
   having--which are usually caused by an electrolyte imbalance. But I had
   tried supplementing with all of those, I thought, until I realized that
   I had never tried more sodium. That has made all the difference in the
   world--they are much less frequent now, and less severe when I have
   them, and a couple of crackers stops them in their tracks.


   My leg cramps were actually caused by adopting a healthier diet, with
   virtually no processed foods, which apparently account for 710% of the
   sodium intake in the American diet. I was one of those very few people
   who was not getting enough sodium--and also one of the 80% for whom
   more sodium does not cause higher blood pressure.

   All medications have possible side effects, but not all patients suffer
   from them.


   [86]Important Information About LIPITOR (atorvastatin calcium) Tablets


What Are the Possible Side Effects of LIPITOR (atorvastatin calcium) Tablets?

   LIPITOR (atorvastatin calcium) tablets can cause serious side effects.
   These side effects have happened only to a small number of people. Your
   doctor can monitor you for them. These side effects usually go away if
   your dose is lowered or LIPITOR is stopped.

   These serious side effects include:
     * Muscle problems. LIPITOR can cause serious muscle problems that can
       lead to kidney problems, including kidney failure. You have a
       higher chance for muscle problems if you are taking certain other
       medicines with LIPITOR.
     * Liver problems. LIPITOR can cause liver problems. Your doctor may
       do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking LIPITOR,
       and while you take it.

   Call your doctor right away if:
     * You have muscle problems like weakness, tenderness, or pain that
       happen without a good reason, especially if you also have a fever
       or feel more tired than usual
     * You have allergic reactions including swelling of the face, lips,
       tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or
       swallowing, which may require treatment right away
     * You experience nausea and vomiting
     * You pass brown or dark-colored urine
     * You feel more tired than usual
     * Your skin and whites of your eyes get yellow
     * You have stomach pain
     * You have an allergic skin reaction

   In clinical studies, patients reported the following common side
   effects while taking LIPITOR (atorvastatin calcium) tablets:
     * Diarrhea
     * Upset stomach
     * Muscle and joint pain
     * Alterations in some laboratory tests

   The following additional side effects have been reported with LIPITOR
   (atorvastatin calcium) tablets:
     * Tiredness
     * Tendon problems

   Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have side effects that bother
   you or that will not go away. These are not all the side effects of
   LIPITOR (atorvastatin calcium) tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist
   for a complete list.


   I have highlighted the one which led me to quit lipitor several years
   ago. My problems were not severe, but sufficient for me to start
   searching and reading. I admit my bias. Since that time I have done a
   lot of reading on cholesterol and statins. I will never take one again
   regardless of my lipid levels.

   Watch out for side effects from the Lipitor!  Some don't have any, but
   for me it was like having rocks buried in my muscles.  Every movement
   hurt.  I quit taking the stuff pretty quickly.


   I was given the Lipitor before my T2 diagnosis.  Once my BG came under
   control, all of my cholesterol numbers improved to a point where the
   Lipitor wasn't necessary anyway.


   My wife takes thyroid meds, but I don't think she's on synthroid any
   longer.  Don't be surprised if you have to make adjustments in the
   prescription.  It doesn't take much synthroid to make big changes, so
   its not unusual to have to increase or decrease the dose - and it may
   happen several times.

   New,


   I have been on synthroid for more than 20 years. My dosage was reduced
   because of too high thyroid reading, my dose is .112 mg now. Thyroid
   helps increase energy and metabolism and is thus good for a diabetic.


   I have been on Lipitor for more than 15 years, low dose 10 mg. When I
   tried to go to 20 mgs, I had some pain issues. Keeping LDL low is
   essential for diabetics since CVD is the complication that kills  most
   type-2 diabetics, 65%. Most doctors and the ADA, FDA, and CDC indicate
   that glucose control does not prevent CVD in type-2 diabetics; the
   medications that do are those that lower cholesterol and blood
   pressure. High doses of Lipitor have been shown to raise glucose levels
   slightly, but most doctor think the benefits of Lipitor greatly out
   weigh the risks. As the dose of Lipitor is raise the benefit gain gets
   less. I have been quite happy with my 10 mg and when I tried to go off
   it, I had a 30% gain in LDL; so, I went back on it and continue to take
   it today.

   I've no personal experience with the synthroid (though my sigot takes
   it), but like the others have also never heard of problems if the
   dosage is appropriate.  My doc finally told me to start taking Niacin
   to get my LDL numbers a little lower (total is good) even though the
   labs say it is at the very bottom of the scale.

   I wiil chime in about synthroid. I have taken it for several years, and
   thyroid disease seems more predominate in diabetics as a group. The
   trick is for your doctor to get the right amount of Med for you....this
   will require fairly frequent blood tests, and it is a Med you will be
   on for the rest of your life. Your thyroid is your bodies
   thermostat...controlling the furnace so to speak. If your thyrold is
   low then you are cold, sluget and weight loss is difficult. To high and
   you can have sweats and heart palpatations. There is a host of other
   symptoms, so pay very close attention to your levels. Good luck!

   The issue of Lipitor or using any other statins is funny to me.
   Diabetes is always associated with high cholesterol problems. Now, if
   one is taking good care of lowering blood sugar (as you are doing
   pretty well with such A1C level), then, high cholesterol would not be a
   problem as long as you are taking good care of your diet and
   exercising.

   Now, the only problem of yours is thyroid, which can be treated
   appropriately, so, all other problems would be resolved. The use of
   statins (Lipitor) is associated with high blood sugar (or diabetes).
   So, this is the funniest part I would like to underline: you are
   already a diabetic, but adding Lipitor would alter your blood sugar
   more. Talk to your doctor about this side effect.

   Lead,


   Tried Niacin once, think it bother my stomach and caused cramping in my
   cavs; so, only took a couple of pills. If I were in target range, I
   would not take additional medications. I am very big on taking only the
   medication that I need and in the lowest dosage possible. Lipitor is a
   fine example where high doses are associated with higher blood sugar
   and in some cases muscle pain. Everything in moderation for me, except
   maybe exercise, but to me my exercise levels are right.
