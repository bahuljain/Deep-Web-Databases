Runners Over 65 Have Walking Metabolism Similar to 20-Somethings

   MONDAY, Nov. 24, 2014 (HealthDay News) — Jogging helps seniors maintain
   their ability to walk, a new study finds.

   The researchers looked at people older than 65 who either ran or walked
   for exercise. Those who ran at least 30 minutes three times a week were
   less likely to have age-related physical decline in walking than
   walkers.

   In fact, joggers were 7 percent to 10 percent more efficient at walking
   than those who didn’t jog, according to the study published online Nov.
   20 in the journal PLoS One.

   “What we found is that older adults who regularly participate in
   high-aerobic activities — running in particular — have what we call a
   lower metabolic cost of walking than older, sedentary adults. In fact,
   their metabolic cost of walking is similar to young adults in their
   20s,” Justus Ortega, associate professor and director of the
   Biomechanics Lab at Humboldt State University in Arcata, Calif., said
   in a university news release.

   Metabolic cost — which refers to the amount of energy required to move
   — naturally increases with age. High metabolic cost makes walking more
   difficult and tiring. A decline in walking ability is a major predictor
   of health problems in older adults.

   “The bottom line is that running keeps you younger, at least in terms
   of efficiency,” study co-author Rodger Kram, a professor of integrative
   physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said in the news
   release.

   The researchers plan to investigate whether other highly aerobic
   activities — such as cycling and swimming — also slow age-related
   physical decline.
