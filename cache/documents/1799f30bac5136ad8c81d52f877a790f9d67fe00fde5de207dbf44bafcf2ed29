   Skin cancer isn't the only health consequence of sun exposureand in
   fact, in some ways, soaking up some rays may actually improve your
   wellbeing.

The good, the bad, and the sunny

   by Amanda MacMillan

   You know that the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause [94]skin cancer
   and premature aging, and that wearing sunscreen (year-round!) is an
   important way to protect yourself. But research has shown that sunlight
   also seems to affect health in a lot of other ways, both positively and
   negatively.
   "One American dies every hour from [95]skin cancer, and the
   overwhelming majority of these cancers are caused by overexposure to UV
   lightthere's no question about that," says Darrell Rigel, MD, clinical
   professor of dermatology at New York University Langone Medical Center.
   "But that doesn't mean you should stay inside all day or that there
   aren't plenty of health benefits to being outdoors. You just have to
   balance everything and use common sense to protect yourself." Here's
   what you need to know so you can make smart choices when you step
   outside.
