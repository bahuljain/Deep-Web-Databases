Exercise May Help Prevent Pregnancy-Linked Pelvic Pain

   October 13, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67033.jpg?resize=180:135]

   TUESDAY, Oct. 13, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Women who routinely exercise
   in the three months prior to conceiving may help themselves avoid the
   pelvic pain that often occurs during pregnancy, Norwegian research
   suggests.

   The finding is focused on so-called “pelvic girdle pain,” the
   researchers explained. The name reflects a constellation of joint and
   ligament pain often brought on by pregnancy, and for 2 percent to 3
   percent of women, this pain can linger for as long as a year after
   delivery.

   According to the researchers, such pain typically occurs in the rear
   region of the pelvis, as well as at the juncture where the pubic bone
   meets up with the front section of the pelvis, the researchers
   explained.

   Would exercise help? To find out, investigators led by Dr. Katrine Mari
   Owe, of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, reviewed data on more
   than 39,000 women who had been enrolled in a national study between
   1999 and 2008.

   Almost 57 percent said they exercised at least three times a week in
   the three months before becoming pregnant. And nine out of 10 of those
   exercising women said they had continued to exercise as late as 17
   weeks into their pregnancy.

   While the study couldn’t prove cause-and-effect, risk factors raising a
   mom-to-be’s odds for pelvic girdle pain included smoking, obesity and
   having a prior history of depression or lower back pain. Young
   mothers-to-be (those under 25) also appeared to face a higher risk than
   older women, the study found.

   However, the risk was lower among those women who had exercised three
   to five times per week in the months prior to pregnancy, Owe’s team
   reported.

   Was any type of exercise more effective? After looking at 13 different
   types of exercise, Owe’s team found that high-impact exercise — such as
   jogging, aerobics, and ball games — were most strongly associated with
   a diminished risk for pelvic pain.

   Specifically, high-impact exercise performed three to five times a week
   prior to pregnancy was linked to a 14 percent dip in risk by the time
   the women had reached their 30th week of gestation, the researchers
   found.

   The findings were published online Oct. 4 in the British Journal of
   Sports Medicine.
