       but when she failed her TAKS test I realized I needed to get her
       help. I looked around at many places for help, but just happened to
       come across tutoring club by chance. I walked in to inquire and was
       sold immediately. Mr Benjamin and his wife Michelle are the
       absolute nicest, most sincere and dedicated people I know. My
       daughter has been going to the tutoring club over a year now and
       she not only is thriving in her classes, but she LOVES to go to
       tutoring. She is actually disappointed when I have to work late or
       if they close for a holiday...so she begs to stay for 2 hours on
       her next session to make up for what she missed! Her reading has
       improved greatly and she now has a much more extensive vocabulary.
       I am proud of her for her hard work, and so happy that I found a
       place that cares about my daughter and her success as much as I do.
       They have given her so much more confidence and she always leaves
       the tutoring place with an infectious laugh and smile because she
       has had such a great time while she was there!

       club for one year now. I am very happy with her progress. Unlike
       kumon, the teachers at tutoring club give one on one attention to
       each student. I get regular updates on my daughter's progress from
       Mr. Alan. I feel that I am able to express my concerns about my
       daughter's studies more freely here. I highly recommend this place.

       great place to enhance your child's academic experience, I highly
       recommend the Tutoring Club in League City.
       The Tutoring Club is run by Alan Benjamin, a motivational &
       positive influence for the students as well as their families.The
       staff includes a variety of tutors who focus on the individual
       needs and learning style of each student. My two children look
       forward to spending time at theTutoring Club each week. They love
       the attention they receive and the confidence they feel in
       overcoming challenging subjects.
       As a parent seeking the best for my children, I would choose no
       other place than the Tutoring Club.
