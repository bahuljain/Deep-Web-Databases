What is buffer in c language. ?

   i want to allocate 2*650000 byte of memory in c language to open one
   binary file and extract data of it(data are in 12 bit format so we need
   2 byte to save one data). someone suggest me to use buffers but i don't
   know how and what kind of this buffer must use.

   Best Answer:  ... I would advise against trying to allocate over a
   megabyte of memory to store your file. It's a file for a reason, do
   whatever you need to do with it *without* loading it into memory.

       a buffer is just a pre-allocated area of memory where you store
       your data while you're processing it. Since YOU define the buffer
       in code, "what kind" of buffer is not a question. It is "whatever
       kind" that you decide to make it, by the way your code is written.
       Any time you read from a disk you read into a buffer. Your read
       routine probably has provision for a pointer to an area of memory
       the data will be stored in AFTER it is read. This IS your buffer.
       The trouble is, many compilers don't allow for more than 32000
       bytes of buffer space (some 65000). I hope you "2*650000" is a
       typo! That is HUGE! You need to develope an algorithm that will
       divide this up into smaller "chunks" that your compiler can handle.

       buffer is the name given to the temporary memory.
       Instead of using 2*650000 bytes of memory, you can use say 1024
       bytes.
       Read from the file 1024 bytes at any instant and store it in 1024
       bytes of memory. Use this data. Then read more 1024 bytes of data
       again and so on.
       That's all what buffer is.
       Hope this helps.

       Why do you need such a large buffer?
       Instead of reading an entire file into memory and working through
       it, why not use simple fopen("mybinaryfile.ext", "rb") command in
       binary mode and read the pieces as necessary?

       2*650000 is 1,300,000 bytes. I remember when that was alot. Now
       it's a tenth of a percent of the RAM on my machine. The data would
       fit on one of those floppy drives. Computers don't even come with
       them anymore. If your compiler can't cope with this, boot your
       machine from a Knoppix CD and use that. Read and write from thumb
       drive.
       You could compile this and run it with
       myprog.exe < mybiginputfile > mybigoutputfile
       char buf[1300000];
       main( ) {
       long int i;
       if (read(1, buf, 1300000) < 0) {
       /* handle the error here */
       exit(1);
       }
       /* do whatever it is you want to do with it here, for example:
       for (i = 0; i < 1300000; i++) {
       if (i & 1) {
       buf[i] &= 0x7f;
       }
       }
       */
       if (write(2, buf, 1300000) < 0) {
       /* handle the write error here */
       exit(1);
       }
       return 0;
       }
