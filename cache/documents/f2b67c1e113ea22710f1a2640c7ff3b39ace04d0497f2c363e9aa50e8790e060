[96]Is Insulin Right for You?

   If you have type 2 diabetes, you have more options to control blood
   sugar than ever before.

Expert Advice: 18 Questions About Taking Insulin

     __________________________________________________________________

   Q: How can I exercise while taking insulin?
   A: Exercise is great because it's a natural way to lower your blood
   sugar. However, if you're taking insulin you need to take this into
   account when planning your day. You may experience low blood sugar
   during exercise, or afterward. Again, having a sugar source
   handywatered-down Gatorade, glucose tablets, candyis important, and
   can quickly reverse blood sugar that is too low.
   Q: What kind of food can I eat while taking insulin?
   A: You will still have to eat a healthy diet. You can eat as much fish,
   poultry, and green vegetables (with the exception of peas) as you like,
   as these are less likely to affect blood sugar as much as
   carbohydrate-rich food. You'll need to match your insulin to the amount
   of carbohydrates you eat in a meal. However, some foods can make it
   harder for the insulin to control your rise in blood sugar.
   You should limit starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn, and peas,
   which can cause blood sugar to rise. With fruit you also need to be
   careful. Berries are okay, but pineapples and grapes and cherries are
   tough.
   Eating a piece of fruit as an afternoon snack is a very reasonable
   thing to do, but not as a before-bed snack or first time in the
   morning, which can make it harder for insulin to control blood
   sugar.(That is because hormones that are associated with waking up make
   it more difficult for insulin to work, and when you're asleep, your
   sugar will rise because you're burning fewer calories.) It can take
   some trial and error to figure out what food you can eat while keeping
   blood sugar in the safe zone.
   Q: How do I store insulin?
   A: Once insulin has been opened, for pretty much all types of insulin
   you can store it at room temperature for about six weeks. It doesn't
   have to be refrigerated. However, you should keep it in a relatively
   cool place, especially if the room temperature in your home is 85° or
   more.
   Q: What IS insulin? Is it a drug or a hormone?
   A: In a way, it's both. But first and foremost, insulin is a hormone.
   The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin and release it when you eat
   a meal. It lowers the blood sugar by multiple mechanisms, but basically
   by causing cells to take the sugar out of the blood. And for people who
   aren't making enough insulin on their own, and must take it to treat
   their diabetes, insulin is, technically, a drug.
   Q: What exactly is insulin resistance?
   A: Insulin resistance occurs when a person becomes less sensitive to
   the hormone and he or she needs to release more and more insulin to
   lower the blood sugar by the same amount. Insulin resistance further
   depletes the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas and leads to
   progression of diabetes. Obesity is a major contributor to insulin
   resistance, while a healthy diet and physical activity can help improve
   insulin sensitivity.
   Q: Can insulin prevent diabetes complications, like nerve damage, heart
   disease, and blindness?
   A: There is evidence to suggest that if taking insulin leads to better
   blood sugar control, people are less likely to develop complications.
   And the earlier you are able to get your blood sugar under tight
   control, the better your chance of avoiding these complications.
   Q: What if I skip my insulin? Could I die?
   A: Odds are you won't. But it depends on how often or for how long you
   skip your insulin. I tell my patients who use insulin multiple times a
   day that if they miss a shot, they need to cut the carbohydrate content
   of the food they eat that day, drink more water to counter the
   dehydration associated with higher blood sugar, and eat more green
   vegetables and less starch.
   Q: What is an insulin pump? Do I need one?
   A: Probably not. An insulin pump is basically a system for delivering
   the hormone to your body. It can be adjusted to release different
   amounts throughout the day. While these devices can be helpful for
   people with type 1 diabetes, for most type 2 diabetics they're not
   necessary.
   Q: Can I get addicted to insulin?
   A: If you're asking whether your body can become dependent on insulin,
   it depends. If your body is still producing some insulin on its own,
   there's a chance you could reduce your need for extra insulin by eating
   healthier, becoming more active, and losing weight. However, if your
   body can no longer produce any insulin on its own, you will indeed be
   dependent on it, but not because you're taking insulin as a drug. In
   type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance damages your natural
   insulin-producing cells and this may increase your need for taking
   insulin as a drug. Disease progression can leave you dependent on
   insulinnot the insulin itself.
