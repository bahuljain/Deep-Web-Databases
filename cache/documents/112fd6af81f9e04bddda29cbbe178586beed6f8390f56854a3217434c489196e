   Sanofi cholesterol drug touted as potential $3 billion blockbuster
   Reuters Wednesday, September 25, 2013

   By Natalie Huet
   PARIS (Reuters) - A new cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and
   Regeneron has the potential to become a $3-billion-dollar-plus
   blockbuster, according to analysts awaiting imminent late-stage trial
   results.
   The drug, dubbed alirocumab, is part of a group of biotech medicines
   known as PCSK9 inhibitors that offer a new way of fighting the build-up
   of artery-clogging fatty deposits that put millions of patients
   worldwide at risk of heart attacks.
   PCSK9 inhibitors are eyed as potentially the biggest advance in the
   fight against heart diseases since statin drugs such as Lipitor and
   Zocor, now widely available as cheap generics, were launched more than
   two decades ago.
   The drugs are self-injectable, man-made antibodies targeting a protein
   that prevents the body from eliminating "bad" LDL cholesterol from the
   bloodstream. They work differently from statins - pills that inhibit
   the liver's production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.
   "Physician feedback suggests high awareness amongst cardiologists and
   planned prescribing habits support multi-billion dollar potential for
   the class," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday,
   forecasting peak annual sales of alirocumab of more than $3 billion.
   Independent research firm BioMedTracker sees sales of alirocumab
   reaching $3.7 billion by 2023.
   Sanofi and U.S. biotech firm Regeneron are among leaders in the race to
   bring a drug from this new class to market, neck-and-neck with Amgen.
   Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Roche have rival products at earlier stages of
   clinical development.
   If positive, results from a first 100-patient trial - due any day now -
   will boost Sanofi's confidence in its drug, which may reach the market
   by 2015. But its ultimate success depends on longer-term studies
   involving thousands of patients, some of which will only produce
   results in around five years.
   In the first Phase III study, alirocumab, which has cut levels of LDL
   cholesterol by up to 72 percent in Phase II trials, is being tested
   against Merck's Zetia, which can lower LDL cholesterol by 19-24
   percent. Deutsche analysts expect it to easily achieve its goal in the
   trial.
   PRICE HURDLE
   Alirocumab is likely to used in patients with genetically-high
   cholesterol levels, high-risk patients who do not hit their cholesterol
   goals on statins alone, and patients intolerant to statins, whose side
   effects can include muscle pain.
   Doctors at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Amsterdam
   earlier this month said PCSK9 drugs could be a valuable new weapon
   against heart disease.
   But many were wary of predicting widespread use before seeing
   final-stage clinical data, following past disappoints with other heart
   drugs, including pills raising "good" HDL cholesterol.
   The requirement for the new medicines to be injected and their expected
   high cost are also seen as potential deterrents, with pricing expected
   to be especially an issue in Europe, where healthcare spending is
   pressured by deficit-slashing policies.
   For alirocumab, analysts expect a price of around $15 per day,
   comparable to the cost of injectable diabetes drugs known as GLP-1s,
   such as Novo Nordisk's Victoza.
   At an investor conference earlier this month, Sanofi's CEO Chris
   Viehbacher said the French drugmaker could look at nearly doubling its
   stake in Regeneron, voicing confidence in the drug's success.
   "When you look at the number of patients who are willing to inject
   themselves daily for diabetes, and you know a lot of those patients are
   also going to be in your patient population for PCSK9, I actually think
   that the injectable part is not going to be as big a barrier as people
   think," Viehbacher said.
   "I think it is going to be a paradigm shift for healthcare and a
   potentially huge opportunity for us."
