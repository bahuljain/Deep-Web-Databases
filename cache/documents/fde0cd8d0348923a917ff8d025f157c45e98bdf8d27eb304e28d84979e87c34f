   Best Answer:  There are a couple of ways to free memory in VB.
   One is to make the array variable local to a function. When the
   function returns, the array is deleted, returning the memory. To do
   this, declare the array with the Private statement.
   Another way, if you are using dynamic arrays, is to ReDim the array.
   You can ReDim to a size of 1, thereby releasing the original memory.
   Of course, don't do this while you are using the array.

       better to persist such a large array to a database file, where the
       index is the primary key to the table. it will be slower, but
       stable. disk space is cheap.
