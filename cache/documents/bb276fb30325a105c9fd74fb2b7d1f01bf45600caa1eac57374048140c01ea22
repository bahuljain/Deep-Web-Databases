   Ever feel like it’s been one of those days? We’ve been there, too.
   Luckily, it’s possible to turn your day around by simply changing your
   mindset. See below for expert advice on dealing with those little joy
   sucks.

That “Here I am again, walking to work again” mundane feeling

   Remove your blinders and take in your surroundings. One Harvard study
   had 2,250 people rate their [99]happiness levels, noting what they were
   doing and whether they were focused on it. In terms of contentment, it
   mattered less what they did than how immersed they were in it, the
   researchers found. Check out the architecture of the buildings you
   pass. Feel the sun on your shoulders. Breathe in that pile of garbage.
   (Um, OK, not that.)

That “Work stress is gonna kill me” feeling

   Reminding yourself what you love about your job can help ease tension,
   especially the kind that comes from feeling like nothing is under your
   control. “Prepping for teaching is a buzzkill for me,” says professor
   Nicholas Epley, PhD. “So next to my computer, I keep cards from
   graduating students saying how much they appreciated my class. It helps
   me remember who I’m creating the class for.”

That “I’m so going to miss my train” feeling

   Fake out the end of your day, Epley recommends; if you have to leave
   the office at 6, pretend the day is done at 5:30. That will leave you
   half an hour to tie up loose ends so you don’t have to sprint like a
   crazy woman. Set an alarm on your computer to remind you that the end
   of the day is near.

That “My husband isn’t listening to me” feeling

   Maddening, isn’t it? You spend five minutes telling him something and
   he says, “Can you repeat that?” One helpful approach: “Cue your husband
   that you need him to listen,” suggests relationship expert Vagdevi
   Meunier, PsyD. “I like to say that the UPS package isn’t delivered when
   it’s dropped on your doorstep but when you sign for it,” she says. “To
   make sure your message is taken in, say, ‘Do you have a minute? I need
   your attention.'”

That “I just got home and need to chill” feeling

   Resist the urge after work to dash to your room and change into sweats,
   says productivity consultant Julie Morgenstern: “You’re fighting the
   order of things. If you give the kids your undivided attention first,
   they’ll be happy, and then you can go take care of yourself.” Also
   smart, she adds: “Before you get home, jot down a few tasks you need to
   do. Otherwise chores can feel overwhelming.”
