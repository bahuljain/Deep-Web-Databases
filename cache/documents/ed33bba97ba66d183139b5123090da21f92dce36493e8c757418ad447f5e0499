   Best Answer:  Hi Mikii Girl!
   Without a doubt, it is aerobics. Here is why. Weight loss is all about
   burning more calories than you consume. Focusing on the calorie burn
   side, it is all about the heart rate and duration of elevation. If you
   spend the same time doing both, then the only variable is what your
   heart rate is.
   When I do Yoga, maybe my heart rate is about 110 beats per minute. When
   I teach my advanced aerobics class, I can keep my heart rate up about
   185 beats per minute, which means I can burn about 1000 calories an
   hour. This is an extreme since I am in very good shape, but I use it to
   highlight the difference between the two exercise modes: aerobics vs.
   yoga.
   Barring your interest level, which is also an important factor, stick
   with the aerobics for efficient weight loss.
   I believe this answers your question, but if not, you may email me.
   Good luck on your diet and fitness goals!

       Say Mikii-gurl:
       It is simple really, output must exceed input to sustain a loss.
       Choose some activity that is enjoyable to you and your friends. Its
       better to workout together. Stats show You would probably never
       stick to it on your own. Fat girls have a problem with
       self-control. It is too easy to eat a half gallon of cookie dough
       ice cream and forgo the exercise when nobody is pushing. Good
       luck...It will take a long time to see results. It will be a life
       change. You will really need to watch what you eat. One piece of
       chicken, not the whole bird! You get the idea, nobody said you was
       stupid, and fat. The weight will eventually come off. How much do
       you want to lose? I suggest you not lose more than 1 or 2 pounds a
       week. At that rate you could probably keep losing for the
       foreseeable future and no one would suspect a thing for a very long
       time. One day in a year or so, you are 100 lbs or more lighter and
       everyone is happy and amazed. You could just keep going until you
       get down to an acceptible weight.
       Please don't report me to the big brother goons for insulting you.
       I don't know you and harbor no hard feelings toward you. The point
       Nazis take away my points constantly. The advise I'm giving is
       meant to help not hurt. I really need 10 points for best answer,
       not lose eight for a violation. Good Luck with losing a lot of
       weight.

       I believe aerobics is good for cardio work, fat burning and muscle
       definition whereas yoga is good for improving strength and learning
       how to control your body. So i guess aerobics would be better if
       you had to choose between the two regarding fat buring but yoga
       combined with say running might be very good for losing weight as
       well.

       Yoga is good for flexibility but only burns about 150 calories an
       hour, while aerobics burns 500.

       Yoga can be a great friend in every diet. It's all about hormones
       balance. There are no "bad" hormones. But when hormones get
       unbalanced, bad things happen in your body. Your body releases
       cortisol when you're under stress. It's part of the whole ‚Äúfight or
       flight‚Äù response. Increased cortisol levels could be making you
       fat. The kind of fat you are most likely to store from elevated
       cortisol is called visceral fat ‚Äî the dangerous belly fat that‚Äôs
       linked to diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
       levels.
       I'm following this great online program that teaches how to use
       YOGA to lose weight. You should check it out as well. This is the
       link of the site: http://yogafitness.toptips.org
       Cheers.

       there is no such thing as better. I'd only suggest yoga if u r a
       man n ineterested in meeting hot women too... you vcan kill 2 birds
       with 1 stone ;-)
       edit: I just noticed u r a woman. well... I'll still suggest
       yoga... competition helps ;) oh btw if u guys are underestimating
       yoga, u'll be in surprise if u try ashtanga or bikram yoga
