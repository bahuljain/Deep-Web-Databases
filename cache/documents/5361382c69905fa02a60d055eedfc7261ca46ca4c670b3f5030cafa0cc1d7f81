The 10 Best Nutrition Tips Ever

   [79]Eat This, Not That!November 10, 2014

   The 10 Best Nutrition Tips Ever

   Diet advice is a lot like fashion. Trends come‚Äîwedge sneakers,
   drop-crotch pants, those skirts that are short in the front and long in
   the back‚Äîand a year or two later they seem hopelessly out of date. But
   the truly stylish always look smart; you‚Äôll never see a photo of
   Pharrell Williams wearing crocs or Victoria Beckham in a meat dress.
   Here at Eat This, Not That! we see the same thing with the lean and
   fit: Those who stay slim don‚Äôt follow diets or nutrition trends. They
   follow common sense eating strategies that keep them looking fit for
   life.


   Giving up gluten, throwing back shots of apple cider vinegar, juicing
   everything in sight‚Äîtry them if you think they make sense. (And if you
   need a little boost to get you back on track, try our [80]Ultimate One
   Day Detox.) But when those of-the-moment diet fads are gathering dust
   in the back of your metaphorical closet, the simple, smart, sensible
   approaches will be there like a favorite pair of jeans or a perfect
   little black dress‚Äîlook-great staples guaranteed to never go out of
   style.


   NUTRITION TIP #1. Hide your weakness.

   If you see it, you‚Äôll eat it. If you don‚Äôt see it, you‚Äôll still eat
   it‚Äîbut not so much. That‚Äôs what a [81]study at Google‚Äôs New York
   office, dubbed ‚ÄúProject M&M‚Äù found. Office managers discovered that
   placing the chocolate candies in opaque containers as opposed to glass
   ones, and giving healthier snacks like nuts and figs more prominent
   shelf space, curbed M&M intake by 3.1 million calories in just seven
   weeks. A similar [82]study published in the Journal of Marketing found
   that people are more likely to overeat small treats from transparent
   packages than from opaque ones. Out of sight, out of mind, out of
   mouth.


   NUTRITION TIP #2. Use the 1 in 10 rule.

   For every 10 grams of carbohydrate listed on the label, look for at
   least one gram of fiber. Why 10:1? That‚Äôs the ratio of carbohydrate to
   fiber in a genuine, unprocessed whole grain. The recommendation comes
   from a [83]study published in the journal Public Health Nutrition that
   evaluated hundreds of grain products; foods that met the 10:1 ratio had
   have less sugar, sodium, and trans fats than those that didn‚Äôt. Getting
   your fiber-rich whole grains is one of these indispensible [84]5 Daily
   Habits That Blast Belly Fat.


   NUTRITION TIP #3. Boost flavor to cut calories.

   Ever notice how everything inside a McDonald‚Äôs‚Äîthe burgers, the fries,
   the shakes‚Äîsmells exactly the same? That sameness of scent is actually
   a tactic that can inspire you to consume more calories. A [85]study in
   the journal Flavour found that the less distinctive the scent of a
   particular food, the more you‚Äôll eat of it. Adding herbs and
   sodium-free spice blends is an easy take advantage of sensory illusion
   that you‚Äôre indulging in something rich‚Äîwithout adding any fat or
   calories to your plate. Furthermore, a recent behavioral [86]study that
   taught adults to spruce up meals with herbs instead of salt led to a
   decrease in sodium consumption by nearly 1000 mg a day (that‚Äôs more
   salt than you‚Äôll find in 5 bags of Doritos!). Double down on the
   delicious health benefits by using [87]The 5 Best Spices for Weight
   Loss.


   NUTRITION TIP #4. Chill pasta to melt fat.

   You can gain less weight from a serving of pasta simply by putting it
   in the fridge. The drop in temperature changes the nature of the
   noodles into something called ‚Äúresistant starch,‚Äù meaning your body has
   to work harder to digest it. Cold pasta is closer in structure to
   natural resistant starches like lentils, peas, beans, and oatmeal,
   which pass through the small intestine intact and are digested in the
   large intestine, where‚Äîwell, it gets kinda gross from there on out. A
   [88]study in the journal Nutrition & Metabolism found that adding
   resistant starch to a meal may also promote fat oxidation. Suffice it
   say, colder noodles = hotter you. But you‚Äôve got to eat it cold: Once
   you heat the pasta up again, you destroy the resistant starch.


   NUTRITION TIP #5. Dim the lights to get lighter.

   A [89]study of fast food restaurants published in the journal
   Psychological Reports found that customers who dined in a relaxed
   environment with dimmed lights and mellow music ate 175 fewer calories
   per meal than if they were in a more typical restaurant environment.
   That may not sound like a dramatic savings, but cutting 175 calories
   from dinner every night could save you more than 18 pounds in a year!


   NUTRITION TIP #6. Eat, Don‚Äôt Drink, Your Fruit

   Juicing may be the rage, but like a certain Mr. Simpson, some juice can
   do more harm than good‚Äîincluding OJ. Researchers at the Harvard School
   of Public Health found that people who consumed one or more servings of
   fruit juice each day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes
   by as much as 21 percent. Conversely, those who ate at least two
   servings each week of certain whole fruits‚Äî particularly blueberries,
   grapes, and apples‚Äîreduced their risk for type 2 diabetes by as much as
   23 percent. So stock up on the [90]Best Fruits for Fat Loss and eat
   them whole.


   NUTRITION TIP #7. Eat before you eat.

   Eating an appetizer of a broth-based soup or even an apple can reduce
   total calorie intake over the course of the meal by up to 20 percent,
   according to a series of ‚ÄúVolumetrics‚Äù [91]studies at Penn State.
   Consider that, according to the Journal of the American Medical
   Association, the average restaurant meal contains 1,128 calories. A 20
   percent savings, just once a day, is enough to help you shed more than
   23 pounds in a year.


   NUTRITION TIP #8. Choose paper, not plastic.

   Here‚Äôs a simple way to improve the health of your shopping cart: A
   series of experiments by Cornell University looked at the effects of
   payment method on food choice. When shoppers used credit cards, they
   bought more unhealthful ‚Äúvice‚Äù foods than they did ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù foods.
   Researchers suggest that you‚Äôre less likely to impulsively buy junk
   food if it means parting with a hundred dollar bill than swiping
   plastic.


   NUTRITION TIP #9. Water down the calories.

   You‚Äôve been told to drink 8 glasses of water a day, but why bother?
   Well, what if staying hydrated could strip pounds off your body?
   According to a [92]study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and
   Metabolism, after drinking approximately 17 ounces of water (about 2
   tall glasses), participants‚Äô metabolic rates increased by 30 percent.
   The researchers estimate that increasing water intake by 1.5 liters a
   day (about 6 cups) would burn an extra 17,400 calories over the course
   of the year‚Äîa weight loss of approximately five pounds! Fill up at the
   tap and read about the [93]4 Surprising Secrets of Bottled Water so you
   stay hydrated the healthy way.


   NUTRITION TIP #10. Remind yourself to lose weight.

   A recent [94]study published online in Health Promotion Practice found
   that people who received weekly text reminders of their daily ‚Äúcalorie
   budget‚Äù and motivational emails made healthier meal and snack choices.
   A simple hack to help you slim down: set up reminders on your
   smartphone, so when 6 a.m. rolls around, it‚Äôs: You make 1200
   calories-a-day look so good! And at lunchtime: Salad for the six-pack,
   baby!
