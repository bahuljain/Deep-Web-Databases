   Activity [23]Calculate My Calories

   I don't do any physical activity other than what I need to do for my
   usual activities, such as going to work or school, grocery shopping, or
   doing chores around the house.

   I do some moderate exercise every day in addition to doing my usual
   activities. For example, I walk about 1.5 to 3 miles a day at about 3
   to 4 miles an hour. Or I do something else that's moderately active.

   I am very active every day in addition to doing my usual activities.
   For example, I walk more than 3 miles a day at about 3 to 4 miles an
   hour. Or I do something else that's very active.

How Many Calories?

   If you want to lose weight, you may need fewer calories. You should
   talk with your health care team for more personalized recommendations,
   but this calculator can help to get you started.

   *Estimates are rounded to the nearest 200 calories. An individual's
   calorie needs may be higher or lower than these average estimates.
