   Best Answer:  The Los Angeles lakers used to be based in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota. Minnesota is know as the "land of a thousand lakes" due to
   the abundance of lakes in the state so the name stayed when the
   franchise relocated to L.A. A knickerbocker has to do with the history
   of the state of NY. When the Dutch originally colonized NY, their
   descendents were called knickerbockers due to a type of breeches that
   they wore. Back in the early to mid 1800s, when Americans headed west
   in covered wagons, they traveled on trails, i.e. the oregon trail,
   santa fe trail, etc. The most famous was the oregon trail and portland
   named its team the trailblazers for this reason. A maverick is
   associated with Texas. It could mean a small, unbranded calf or steer,
   which is I think what the logo has on it. It can also mean like an
   outlaw or one who goes by his own rules. Its a word that has to do with
   the herding days. I'm not 100% sure about clipper but it is a small and
   quick ship so I'm guessing its named after vessels off the coast of
   california since L.A. is near the coast.

       The Clippers are named as such because they were in San Diego
       before they were in Los Angeles. There is more of an association
       with San Diego and the Pacific Ocean than there really is with the
       ocean and Los Angeles.
       The Clippers, before San Diego, were the Buffalo Braves.
