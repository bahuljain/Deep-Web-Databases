   I'm getting frustrated with a daily range I can't get under, but my
   husband says maybe that's as good as can be expected, so please help us
   with a clarification of my blood count profile over a typical day.  I
   will preface the numbers by explaining that 2 months post diagnosis
   type two, I have reduced to normal weight range, have tweaked my diet
   to what seems ideal for me, have solved the dawn effect problem I
   experienced early on, power walk 45 minutes a day, have taken a
   diabetes class and take 1000 mg metformin every morning and 1000 mg
   every evening.  I don't slip, slide or backtrack--I'm disciplined since
   I have a goal of getting back to "normal range" without medication.
   Having said all of that, with 4 tests a day (fasting morning, before
   lunch, before dinner and before the bedtime snack), I now seem "stuck"
   at the numbers I've gotten down to, which typically average about as
   follows over the day :  112, 120, 122, 115.  These individual numbers
   include, on the high end, an occasional frustrating (and inexplicable)
   "spike" to 150-160.  Yesterday's  numbers were:  104, 122, 146, 130.


   I do not seek a "pat on the back" but rather would very much appreciate
   your 100% honest assessment of how these values compare to what one
   needs to do long term to preclude ill effects to health.


   Thank you very much in advance!

   What is your daily menu like? How many carbs are you eating each meal?
   Why are you only testing BEFORE meals and not after? Most of us here
   start testing at 1 and 2 hours after first bite of each meal to
   discover which foods cause spikes.  Some even discover their peak
   post-meal is at 90 mins.  Testing after the meal, and
   investigating/reducing carbs, will tell you why your numbers are stuck
   and help to get them down.

   Hi Nojiko, welcome.


   It can seem frustrating, especially when you don't have all of the
   information you need.  Testing before meals tells you nothing about how
   the meal effects your numbers nor if the carb count was too high.  Your
   before meal numbers are also pretty high, do you eat snacks?


   Here's some advise I wrote to help people with testing, carbs, and
   meals:  [85]click here.  Testing more for a time will help you see just
   what's going on.


   Here's a list of suggested goals by agency:



   RECOMMENDED BLOOD GLUCOSE GOALS


   ADA:……..A1C…..<.7.0….Fasting….90-130.….PP*…….<180

   JOSLIN:....A1C…..<7.0.….Fasting….90-130.….PP*…….<160

   AACE:……A1C…..<6.5..…Fasting……<110…...PP*…….<140

   NON-D:….A1C...4.0-5.7.....Fasting…..70-99…...PP**......
   70-120…**Non-diabetic

   *ADA: “Post-prandial glucose measurements should be made 1–2 hours
   after the beginning of the meal, generally peak levels in patients with
   diabetes.”

   ADA = American Diabetes Assn. Joslin = Joslin Diabetes Center AACE=
   American Association Of Clinical Endocrinologists

   **Non-diabetic= ranges compiled from goals of all agencies.

   I think you're doing a great job, Nojiko.  When is your next A1c
   scheduled?  You will probably see for yourself at that time just how
   well you're doing.  If you want to get  your numbers down further, you
   may want to work some resistance training into your daily routine, in
   order to use some new and different muscles than your body is used to
   with the walking.  It doesn't take many reps with 5 and 6-pound
   dumbbells for me to "surprise" the muscles and drop my BG level lower
   than I usually get with walking, biking, or elliptical alone.  Other
   resistance moves work well, too: ab crunches, tricep dips, wall
   sit-squats, lunges, tricep dips, wall pushaways, extra stairclimbing,
   or just doing some step-ups on one step.  I get more mileage out of my
   regular exercise by throwing some of these in throughout the day.  (And
   evening.)

   Thank you all so very much--you've come through for me again with great
   advice!  I'm feeling less frustrated now and much less "lost in the
   forest".   It's clear from Anna that I need to be testing again after
   meals...what was I thinking?  Anyway, getting that great summary of BG
   acceptable ranges from Lizzy was very helpful to give me the big
   picture, and your site, Lizzy, gives a lot of excellent information and
   advice.  The diet behind the numbers I gave is pretty similar to this
   one example:  Breakfast 1/2 c. low fat cottage cheese, 1 egg and coffee
   (1/2 decafe)--5 g. carbs;  Snack 1 slice of Wasa Crispbreak w no-salt
   peanut butter and 1/2 cup raw cauliflower w a little low fat Ranch
   dressing--7 g. carbs; Lunch 1/2 low carb tortilla + 1 siice Roma
   tomato, lettuce and 2 small pcs. organic chicken--3 g. carbs;  dinner
   1/4 c. boiled garbanzo beans on mixed salad greens and green beans + 1
   chicken burger--5 g. carbs;  evening snack (before bedtime) 2 "Ak-mak"
   sesame crackers with 1 T. almond butter--7 g. carbs.  For Alan's
   further information I vary the evening snack substituting 1 Laughting
   Cow Light cheese triangle or a slice of other low fat cheese for the
   almond butter, or some avocado (still with crackers).  Powerwalker,
   you've given me some great ideas about further exercise to target
   specific muscles as a way to improve numbers, and seeing what you do
   daily is an inspiration to anyone.


   The nutritionist I took the class from keeps repeating "carbs are not
   your enemy", and recommends 120 carbs per day (to adequately feed the
   brain, she says).  As you can see my daily total (in this case around
   30 total carbs) is FAR less than that.  Could any of you critique,
   advise or pass judgment on that?  I'm afraid that more carbs would
   raise my BG greatly.


   Thanks again to all!

   I typically eat around 90 to 120 carbs per day as an active 48 year old
   guy. It has nothing to do with what any nutritionist, or anyone else,
   as hold told me to eat...it solely has to do with my meter says I can
   have Smiley Wink As for how many carbs your brain needs, well your
   brain needs a very specific carb...glucose. It needs your BG levels to
   be within normal ranges, how you get your BG levels there is quite
   irrelevant Smiley Wink

     great ideas about further exercise to target specific muscles as a
     way to improve numbers, and seeing what you do daily is an
     inspiration to anyone.


     The nutritionist I took the class from keeps repeating "carbs are
     not your enemy", and recommends 120 carbs per day (to adequately
     feed the brain, she says).  As you can see my daily total (in this
     case around 30 total carbs) is FAR less than that.  Could any of you
     critique, advise or pass judgment on that?  I'm afraid that more
     carbs would raise my BG greatly.


     Thanks again to all!

   I agree with what Bill said.  Believe me there are many people here and
   on other sites that are apparently brain dead because they eat way less
   than 120 carbs a day! Smiley Very Happy


   Try the testing method and see just what your system can handle.  It's
   better to know than to guess.  The meter doesn't pass judgement, just
   tells it like it is.
