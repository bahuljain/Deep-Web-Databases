   Rugby referee Joubert not meant to be 'thrown under a bus': Gosper AFP
   News Monday, 2 November, 2015
   Julian Guyer
   World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper insisted Sunday the governing
   body had not meant for Craig Joubert to be "thrown under a bus" after
   his contentious World Cup penalty call.
   In the biggest controversy of the six-week tournament, South African
   referee Joubert came under fire after awarding a last-gasp penalty for
   offside, kicked by Bernard Foley, that gave Australia -- on the brink
   of suffering a shock defeat -- a 35-34 quarter-final win over Scotland.
   The match was Joubert's last of the tournament, with Australia reaching
   the final before losing 34-17 to New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.
   In the furore that surrounded the decision, World Rugby were then
   criticised for taking the unusual step of issuing a statement saying
   Joubert, in charge of the 2011 World Cup final, had got it wrong.
   "We made a clarification," Gosper told reporters at a Twickenham press
   conference on Sunday.
   "If there's any regret, it's the perception we may have thrown him
   (Joubert) under a bus, which certainly wasn't our intent.
   "There were questions asked around TMO (television match official)
   protocol at the time, 'could you use it, could you not use it?'"
   The Australian added: "It was normal for us to go on and talk about the
   incident itself, in a transparent way. It was normal for us to then say
   there was a mistake made.
   "Craig Joubert is a world-class referee, he continues to be one of our
   top referees.
   - Outstanding -
   "Referees, like players, make mistakes. That was one.
   "The perception was not where we would have perhaps liked it."
   Existing rules meant Joubert was unable to call upon the TMO in this
   instance, with the use of replay adjudication currently restricted to
   the build-up to scoring a try and foul play.
   In the opening match of the World Cup, England's win over Fiji,
   Joubert's fellow-South African Jaco Peyper was criticised for using the
   TMO too often, amid general complaints that replays were causing
   needlessly long delays to games and robbing match officials of the
   confidence to make their own decisions.
   "The refereeing and the use of the TMO has been outstanding over the
   tournament, in general," said Gosper.
   "These things evolve, as does technology, so as with any part of the
   tournament, we will look at this aspect and see if any adjustments need
   to be made."
   Joubert's decision and his action in sprinting off the field come
   full-time at Twickenham, provoked a storm of protest.
   Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson, a World Cup-winner in 2003,
   tweeted: "Craig Joubert you are a disgrace and should never referee
   again!!"
   But Australia coach Michael Cheika, who had cause to regret a couple of
   calls made by Welsh referee Nigel Owens in the final, sympathised with
   Joubert amid concerns that World Rugby's statement risked opening a
   floodgate of complaints.
   "It's so unfair," said Cheika. "No other referee has had this stuff put
   out there like that and he's a very good referee."
   Wallaby great David Campese was even more scathing, saying: "Whoever
   put that statement out saying the referee got it wrong should be shot."
