Cholesterol, Fat & Salt Making Comeback, But Eating Right At Core Of New
Dietary Guidelines

   [79]The Editors Of Yahoo HealthFebruary 11, 2015
   Cholesterol, Fat & Salt Making Comeback, But Eating Right At Core Of
   New Dietary Guidelines

   Dietary advice can be confusing. Is it OK to eat meat and eggs? Is fat
   in or out? What about grains? How much salt? (Photo: Getty Images)

   An advisory committee‚Äôs recommendations for the nation‚Äôs dietary
   patterns are due soon, and some advice may be changing. The committee
   is expected to downplay the importance of lowering cholesterol intake
   and may put less emphasis on eating lean meats. The panel could also
   tweak its recommendations on exactly how much salt is too much and put
   limits on sugar consumption for the first time.

   Still, despite some revisions, the main advice never changes: eat more
   fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and eat less saturated fats,
   salt and sugar.

   The Agriculture and Health and Human Services Departments will use the
   advisory committee‚Äôs report to write the final version of the 2015
   dietary guidelines, due by the end of this year.

   A look at the upcoming dietary guidelines, and what they mean for
   consumers:

   WHY THEY‚ÄôRE IMPORTANT

   The dietary guidelines are issued every five years. The federal
   government uses them to set standards for school lunches and other
   federal feeding programs, and they serve as the basis for information
   on the nutrition facts panel on the backs of food packages.

   They‚Äôre also used to create the government‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Plate‚Äù icon, which
   replaced the food pyramid and recommends a variety of fruits and
   vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and low-fat dairy.

   Doctors and nutritionists use the guidelines when giving advice, and
   food companies use them to make claims about their food.

   EVOLVING WITH SCIENCE

   The guidelines evolve as science evolves. Take cholesterol.

   In December, the advisory panel said in its preliminary recommendations
   that cholesterol is no longer ‚Äúconsidered a nutrient of concern for
   overconsumption.‚Äù That would be a change from previous guidelines,
   which said Americans eat too much cholesterol. This follows increasing
   medical research showing how much cholesterol is in your bloodstream is
   more complicated than once thought, and depends more on the kinds of
   fats that you eat. Medical groups have moved away from specific targets
   for cholesterol in the diet in recent years.

   It‚Äôs unclear if the recommendation will make it into the final
   guidelines. Dr. Robert Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University
   of Colorado in Denver who is a past president of the American Heart
   Association, says there‚Äôs not enough evidence to make good
   recommendations on cholesterol right now, but ‚Äúno evidence doesn‚Äôt mean
   the evidence is no.‚Äù

   People can enjoy high-cholesterol egg yolks in moderation, he advises,
   but ‚Äúa three- to four-egg omelet isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd ever recommend to
   a patient at risk for cardiovascular disease,‚Äù he says.

   Watch Yahoo News‚Äô Bianna Golodryga talk cholesterol with Nina Teicholz,
   author of ‚ÄòThe Big Fat Surprise‚Äô:

   There‚Äôs also some new science on salt. The 2010 dietary guidelines
   recommend that people eat less than 2,300 milligrams a day. That is
   reduced to 1,500 milligrams for some people at risk of heart disease.

   A 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine said that while lowering
   salt intake is important for heart health, there is no good evidence
   that eating less than 2,300 milligrams a day of sodium offers benefits.
   The advisory panel‚Äôs discussions hint that they may not include the
   lower recommendation for certain groups.

   POLITICAL BATTLES

   While they are based on dietary science, the guidelines aren‚Äôt immune
   to politics. This year, the battles have already started over meat.

   Current guidelines advise that people eat lean meats as a healthy way
   to get protein, but the advisory panel has debated whether lean meats
   should be included. In addition, the draft recommendations say a
   healthy dietary pattern includes fewer ‚Äúred and processed meats‚Äù than
   are currently consumed. The meat industry called the draft
   recommendations absurd.

   The committee has also discussed the idea of including sustainability
   as a dietary goal. The advisory panel said in its draft recommendations
   that there is ‚Äúcompatibility and overlap‚Äù between what is good for
   health and what is good for the environment.

   A diet higher in plant-based foods and lower in animal-based foods is
   ‚Äúmore health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental
   impact than is the current average U.S. diet,‚Äù the draft
   recommendations said.

   Environmentalists have been pushing those recommendations, while
   Congress is pushing back. Language attached to a massive year-end
   spending bill enacted in December noted the advisory committee‚Äôs
   interest in the environment and directed Agriculture Secretary Tom
   Vilsack ‚Äúto only include nutrition and dietary information, not
   extraneous factors‚Äù in final guidelines.

   WHAT WON‚ÄôT CHANGE

   The ‚ÄúMy Plate‚Äù isn‚Äôt expected to change much - the guidelines issued at
   the end of the year will most certainly recommend putting fruits,
   vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins on your plate, accompanied
   by low-fat dairy.

   In its draft recommendations, the panel said the problem it is trying
   to solve is high rates of ‚Äúpreventable chronic disease‚Äù and obesity.

   The panel said the gap is an American diet too high in sodium,
   saturated fat, refined grains, added sugars and calories, and too low
   in vegetables, fruit and whole grains.
