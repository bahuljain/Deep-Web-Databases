Many Breast Cancer Patients Lack Info on Their Cancer

   January 26, 2015
     __________________________________________________________________

   [WHI071.jpg]

   By Kathleen Doheny
   HealthDay Reporter

   MONDAY, Jan. 26, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Many women with breast cancer
   lack basic knowledge about their disease, such as their cancer stage
   and other characteristics, according to a new study.

   The lack of knowledge was even more pronounced among minority women,
   the study authors found.

   This finding is worrisome because knowing about a health condition can
   help people understand why treatment is important to follow, experts
   say.

   “We certainly were surprised at the number of women who knew very
   little about their disease,” said Dr. Rachel Freedman, assistant
   professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical
   oncologist specializing in breast cancer at the Dana-Farber Cancer
   Institute.

   Although the study didn’t specifically look at the reasons behind the
   lack of knowledge, Freedman suspects that women may be overwhelmed when
   they’re initially diagnosed. In addition, she said, individual doctors
   vary in how much information they give and how well they explain the
   cancer characteristics.

   The study is published online Jan. 26 in Cancer.

   Kimlin Tam Ashing, a professor at the Beckman Research Institute at the
   City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the study’s
   findings, and said that quick appointments may also be to blame for the
   knowledge gap.

   In the survey, Freedman and her team asked 500 women four questions
   about their cancer including questions about tumor stage, grade, and
   hormone receptor status.

   Overall, 32 percent to 82 percent of women reported that they knew the
   answers to these questions. But only 20 percent to 58 percent were
   actually correct, depending on the characteristics, the investigators
   found.

   Just 10 percent of white women and 6 percent of black and Hispanic
   women knew all of their cancer characteristics correctly, according to
   the study.

   Cancer “stage” describes the extent of the cancer, whether it is
   invasive or not and if lymph nodes are involved (stages 0 through IV).
   Two-thirds of white women and about half of black and Hispanic women
   were able to correctly identify their cancer’s stage, the researchers
   found.

   Cancer “grade” describes how the cancer cells look under the microscope
   and can help predict its aggressiveness. Just 24 percent of white
   women, 15 percent of black women and 19 percent of Hispanic women knew
   what their cancer grade was, according to the study.

   Two other questions asked about hormone receptor status. One asked
   about whether or not a cancer was HER2 positive. HER2-positive tumors
   test positive for a protein (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)
   that promotes cancer cell growth. Almost two-thirds of white women, and
   just over half of black and Hispanic women were able to answer this
   question accurately, the researchers found.

   The other question about hormone receptor status was whether or not the
   cancer was estrogen receptor-positive. Estrogen receptor-positive
   cancers need estrogen to grow. Other cancers are progesterone
   receptor-positive. Seventy percent of white women knew their estrogen
   receptor status, but fewer than half of the black and Hispanic women
   did, the study revealed.

   Black and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to know and
   have correct responses in each measure. Even after the researchers took
   into account women’s education and their health literacy, there were
   still racial and ethnic differences.

   While the results were disappointing, Freedman added, hopefully, “this
   is a modifiable problem.”

   Doctors and other health care professionals can address the knowledge
   gap in clinics and in practices, she said. She recommends that breast
   cancer patients bring along a partner, friend or other family members.
   “When patients come with people, it always helps,” she said, as they
   can take notes for the patient or think of questions that haven’t
   occurred to the patient.

   “I wasn’t surprised, unfortunately,” Ashing said of the current study.

   The danger of not knowing information about your breast cancer, she
   said, is that it “might influence women’s decision about treatment
   adherence.” It might also affect how well they stick to schedules
   recommended for follow-up care and testing.

   Along with having someone accompany you to a medical visit, she
   recommended that breast cancer patients ask if they can talk to another
   patient with the same diagnosis. She has studied this approach, known
   as “peer navigation,” and found it to be helpful.
