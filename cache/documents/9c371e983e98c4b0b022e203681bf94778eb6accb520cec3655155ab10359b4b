   Best Answer:  NA or CNA = nursing assistant or certified nursing
   assistant. Not really a nurse. It's about a 1 month program, doesn't
   earn you a degree, but you can be certified or licensed through the
   state.
   LPN or LVN = Licensed Pracitical or Licensed Vocational Nurse. Usually
   a 1 year program, does NOT earn you any degree, but you are eligible
   for state licensure as a LPN / LVN. More educated than a nursing
   assistant, can pass certain medications, perform certain skills like
   wound care, etc., but still not as qualified or hold as much
   responsibility as a RN
   RN = registered nurse, you can be one with a minimum of a 2 year
   Associates Degree. Trained in all aspects of anatomy, physiology,
   disease pathology. Expected to perform complex assessments of the
   patient, create nursing diagnoses, establish goals and a care plan
   designed to meet those goals. Retains a high level of legal
   responsibility, even if tasks are delegated to assistive personel like
   CNAs or LPNs.
   BSN = Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which is just a 4 year RN degree.
   Both the 2 year and the BSN graduates sit for the exact same licensure
   exam and earn the same RN license. The difference between the 2 is many
   more general education courses, and ,more nursing courses which would
   include Public Health Nursing, nursing research, nursing leadership /
   management, and more in-depth learning about different nursing care
   models and the history of the profession. With a BSN degree you are
   more qualified for administrative or management positions, but not at
   any advantage over 2 year RNs if you are only seeking a regular
   hospital staff nursing job - my hospital pays only $1 more per hour for
   BSN staff nurses.
   CRNA = an advanced practice nurse who specializes in Anesthesia through
   a masters degree; the highest paying nursing job available, starting at
   about $100,000 per year - but highly competative field and you must be
   a stellar performer both academically and professionally to even get
   accepted into anesthesia school
   There are many specialties you can get into, many of which were listed
   above in a previous answer. But I will say that you can work in any
   number of areas as a RN. If you really enjoy your specialty area, there
   are certification exams you can take to earn the title RN,C or you can
   go back to graduate school to become a Clinical Nurse Specialist of a
   specialty or a Nurse Practitioner to work with specific populations
   (like Pediatrics, or Gerontology).

       Hey,
       in answer to this question, Nursing Career: What are the different
       titles i.e.- BSN, RN, A, LVN, LPN, ect.?, I say you that take a
       look at this site [123]http://asknursingonline.com may be it can
       help you
       As you described; "Nursing Career: What are the different titles

       different Nursing 'titles' such as RN (Registered Nurse),
       BSN(Bachlor's in Science of Nursing) NA?(Nurse Assistant), CRNA
       (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist), LPN and LVN. I would just
       like to know if there are any more such titles? What fields can a
       Nurse can specialize in? LIke, if I like working with kids for
       example, what would I have to specilize in? and What are the

       BSN = RN + 4 year degree in nursing
       RN = 2 year associates program
       APRN = RN + graduate degree
       LPN = 2 year program with licensure
       CNA = certificate program
       Nurses can specialize in any healthcare field. If you want to work
       with children, you would work in pediatrics. If enter into a 4 year
       nursing school, you will get experience in almost every field.
