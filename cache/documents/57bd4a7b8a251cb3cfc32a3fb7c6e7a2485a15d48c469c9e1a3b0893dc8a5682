   Initial investments already made by S2G Ventures include these
   companies, forming a multi-stage portfolio:
   Mercaris℠: An online marketplace and data subscription service for
   stakeholders in organic, non-GMO and other identity-preserved
   commodities ShopWell™: The leading digital platform for personalized
   food recommendations that improve nutrition MycoTechnology: Developed a
   revolutionary food-processing platform that improves the taste and
   functionality of stevia, coffee, grains and cacao reducing the need for
   masking agents such as sugar Maple Hill Creamery™: Leading maker of
   yogurt and other dairy products made exclusively from certified 100%
   grass-fed organic milk Beyond Meat®: Plant protein with the taste and
   texture of meat Sweetgreen®: A destination for simple, seasonal,
   healthy food Midwestern BioAg: Better farming through better soils
   Shenandoah Growers®: Premier brand for live and fresh cut herbs
   The S2G leadership team, and several portfolio company executives,
   discussed the fund during a panel discussion at the New York Times Food
   for Tomorrow conference at Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture
   in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. Victor Friedberg, S2G Ventures co-founder and
   managing director, presented S2G Ventures’ mission and the group’s goal
   to empower world-class entrepreneurs providing the healthy food
   consumers want.
   “We’re seeing tectonic shifts in the food industry that consumers are
   driving. People want better tasting, more nutritious, healthy and
   sustainable food. The problem is our existing food system is designed
   to produce cheap calories, and it is not designed to supply healthy,
   sustainable and affordable nutrition at scale,” says Friedberg. “This
   provides a great opportunity for innovators and investors, and S2G is
   seizing the opportunity.”
   Chuck Templeton, founder and former CEO of OpenTable, and Sanjeev
   Krishnan, a career investor focused on venture and growth companies,
   join Friedberg as the team guiding investment decisions at S2G. The
   investment strategy is described as “soil to shelf”, which is a systems
   approach to investing.
   "This $1.4 trillion sector is undergoing massive change and is
   under-invested with risk capital,” says Krishnan. “We think our
   approach of understanding the system from ‘soil to shelf’ is a unique
   and proactive way to create value, minimize risk and feed the changing
   consumer.”
   Some key areas of interest for S2G partners are:
   Soil health and sustainable land management Organic, non-GMO and other
   “identity” produce and commodities Controlled-environment growing
   platforms and brands Real, nutritious and functional ingredients
   Healthy consumer packaged goods Food logistics, including storage,
   distribution and transportation Healthy food retail and restaurant
   formats IT platforms that increase access to healthy, sustainable and
   local food
   S2G Ventures offers companies more than capital.
   “We are focused on helping entrepreneurs build businesses that meet the
   needs of a changing consumer,” says Templeton. “By following a systems
   investing approach with other mission-aligned co-investors and food
   industry stakeholders, we and our portfolio companies can help make
   healthy food more accessible and environmentally friendly.”
