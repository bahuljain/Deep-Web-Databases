Scott Walker’s gloomy pitch for the presidency

   Scott Walker’s gloomy pitch for the presidency

   CONCORD, NH — Scott Walker is worried.

   He’s worried about America. He’s worried about his kids and his
   grandchildren, and everyone else’s. He’s worried about Islamic
   radicalism. He’s worried about too many people being on food stamps.

   In a recent speech here, the Wisconsin governor used the word “worry”
   or “worried” 12 times in the space of 15 minutes.

   “As a parent today, I’m worried. I’m worried for our country,” Walker
   told a few hundred conservative activists in a darkened amphitheater,
   standing in front of a red stage curtain. “I’m worried about my sons
   and your sons and daughters, my nieces and your nieces and nephews and
   grandsons and granddaughters, and I’m worried that we’re headed down
   that same path that worried me years ago in my own state.”

   Walker’s message, just a few months into his nascent (and still
   unofficial) presidential campaign, has been largely a negative one.
   There is an undertone of testiness in his stump speech, leavened with
   chest-swelling machismo fueled by his defeat of a recall effort in 2012
   and his re-election in 2014.

   He sounds alternately bitter and boastful about the opposition to his
   reforms in Wisconsin and the protests that dominated Madison leading up
   to the recall. The attempt by Walker’s opponents to recall him was a
   dramatic chapter in political history, and his survival has been a real
   accomplishment, but it’s left him with a bit of a chip on his shoulder.
   In January, he went on at length during an event in Iowa about how he
   and his family had received death threats, even telling the crowd that
   someone told him “they would gut my wife like a deer.”

   Walker is also angry about people in America who he thinks are on the
   take from their fellow taxpayers. It’s here that his message has a bit
   of a retro feel, reminiscent of Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” comments in
   the 2012 presidential election that did such damage to his candidacy.
   Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who in 2012 was Romney’s running mate,
   [74]talked quite often during the 2010 election season about his
   concern that too many Americans were becoming “takers” rather than
   “makers.”

   But Ryan later [75]distanced himself from such rhetoric , conceding in
   a book he published last year that complaining about people receiving
   government benefits is “just lumping people in this category without
   any regard for their personal stories.”

   “It sounds like we’re saying that people who are struggling are
   deadbeats, as if they haven’t made it already or aren’t trying hard
   enough,” Ryan wrote. He has focused more of his attention and energy
   since the 2012 election on seeking to understand [76]the challenges of
   people living in poverty and proposing solutions to help them with
   their challenges.

   Here in New Hampshire, however, Walker — speaking to a largely white,
   older audience — riffed for a few minutes on the theme of how too many
   people in America are receiving government assistance.

   “You know, this president and his allies tend to measure success in
   government by how many people are dependent on government, by how many
   people are on Medicaid and food stamps and unemployment. We, we should
   measure success by just the opposite, on how many people are no longer
   dependent on the government, right?” Walker said.

   He paused slightly, waiting for the applause, and then, as it came, he
   nodded knowingly.

   “When I was a growing up in that small town of Delavan, I don’t ever
   remember one of my classmates saying to me, ‘Hey, Scott, someday when I
   grow up, I want to be dependent on the government.’ Right? Nobody
   signed my yearbook, ‘Dear Scott, good luck becoming dependent on the
   government,’” Walker said.

   It is the type of messaging that Ryan warned in his book makes
   Republicans sound as if they think Americans receiving federal help
   have no other ambition than to be “deadbeats.”

   Walker’s message on foreign policy is also gloomy. “When you see those
   images of the Jordanian who was burned alive in a cage, when you see
   the beheadings of the Christians from Egypt or others from around the
   world, I got to tell you, that makes me worried not just for myself and
   my country. It makes me worried for my children and your children, and
   anyone else who would dare to travel around this world. And that’s not
   right,” Walker said.

   He drew the loudest cheers of the day in Concord when he railed against
   President Obama’s national security policies. Walker said that he was
   coining a new term to describe his plans for the issue.

   “Something that’s heavy on my heart these days is safety. Safety. You
   know I don’t call it national security. I call it safety,” he said.

   Walker’s voice rose as he described what he sees as Obama’s lack of
   resolve to confront Islamic State and terrorist threats around the
   world, and the crowd responded with an extended and passionate ovation.

   “We need a commander in chief in this country who stands up and once
   and for all says, our biggest threat is radical Islamic terrorism, and
   we will do whatever it takes to weed it out around the world,” Walker
   thundered. “We need a president who will do whatever it takes, whatever
   it takes, who realizes we have an ally in Israel and we should start
   acting like it, who understands that radical Islamic terrorism is like
   a virus. If you don’t take it out entirely, it’s like a virus in your
   computer. It will keep coming back.”

   And then he sounded a note that was straight out of the Bush
   administration’s talking points in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of
   Iraq.

   “I don’t know about all of you, but I’d rather take it to them than
   wait until it comes to us on American soil,” Walker said. (He later
   clarified that he was “not proposing boots on the ground … but I’m not
   taking it off table.”)

   Scott Applewhite/AP)

   “And so, I’m worried about where this country is headed. And I’m
   worried about our position in the world,” he said.

   He then added a qualifier.

   “But I’m an optimist!”

   Walker did this twice during his remarks, detailing the many ways in
   which the days are dark and then adding — as if he were a magician
   transforming himself in the blink of an eye, with a flash and a puff of
   smoke — “but I’m an optimist!” When he ran through his many worries
   about the grandchildren and nieces and nephews, he added, “But I’m an
   optimist. So I’m not just worried.”

   It could be that the Republican primary voters will respond to Walker’s
   us-versus-them, sound-the-alarm rhetoric. But he’s facing a large
   Republican field in which the top three likely candidates — former
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and Sen. Marco Rubio,
   R-Fla. — are making a different bet, that the way to win the presidency
   in 2016 is to carry a positive, hopeful message that aims to expand the
   GOP and attract new voters from constituencies that have traditionally
   not been strong supporters of conservatives: the working class and the
   poor, minorities, and single women.

   “You can be a conservative. You can do it with joy in your heart. You
   don’t have to be angry about this. You can do it in a way that draws
   people toward our cause, and you can win in a purple state,” Bush said
   at a house party in Dover, N.H., the night before Walker’s speech in
   Concord. “And in this country, if you’re going to begin to solve
   problems, we have to win. We have to go out and reach out to people of
   every walk of life, not with a divisive message but one that is
   unifying, one that says that everybody should have a chance to rise
   up.”

   To the extent that Walker was not already a confrontational, combative
   politician, he has been conditioned to be that way by his experience of
   nonstop, all-out partisan combat over the last four years. His red-meat
   approach on the trail is aimed at maximizing participation by
   conservative-base voters. The challenge, of course, is that in order to
   excite the most diehard members of either party in a presidential
   primary, a candidate may alienate moderates and independents, who are
   crucial to winning the presidency in the general election.

   Rep. Rod Blum, a freshman Republican congressman from eastern Iowa,
   said recently that during a phone conversation with Walker, the
   governor boasted to him of his ability to rouse the faithful.

   “He was telling me … in his elections virtually every single
   Republican, registered Republican in that state, voted for him. It was
   like 99-plus percent or something,” Blum said. “So he obviously excited
   the base in Wisconsin.

   “He flat-out just beat the Democrats,” Blum said.

   The arguments against the wisdom of this approach in a presidential
   election are familiar. White voters are a diminishing portion of the
   electorate, and a growing number of states that used to be dependably
   Republican are becoming swing states because of the rising influence of
   Latino voters.

   Ironically, the argument against Walker’s approach has perhaps been
   best articulated by his personal friend and fellow Wisconsinite Paul
   Ryan. Ryan, in his book, was adamant that “as 2012 illustrated,
   focusing heavily on simply turning out our traditional coalition is a
   losing strategy.”

   “We’ve become lazy and complacent. Instead of doing the hard work of
   persuading people, we’ve opted for the easy route, focusing our
   attention on communities where people already agree with us and trying
   to turn out the base,” Ryan wrote. “Preaching to the choir isn’t
   working, and by the way, the choir is shrinking.”
