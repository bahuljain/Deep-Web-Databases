A 'Walking Dead' Stunner: Flowers for Lizzie

   Yahoo TV
   Kimberly PottsMarch 17, 2014

   A  ºWalking Dead º Stunner: Flowers for Lizzie

   Carol (Melissa Suzanne McBride) in The Walking Dead Season 4 episode,
   The Grove.

   SPOILER ALERT: The recap for "The Grove" episode of "The Walking Dead"
   contains storyline and character spoilers.

   The rats, the ones being fed to the walkers at the prison? Yep, that
   was Lizzie. She ºs also the one who mutilated the animal Tyreese found
   in the tombs at the prison. And yes, she was just as crazy as you
   suspected she was... even more so, it turned out, in one of the saddest
   "Walking Dead" episodes of the series º run.

   Tag... You ºre It

   A teapot is boiling on a stove, a basket of pecans sit on a counter
   nearby, and through the kitchen window, we see a young girl being
   chased in the yard by what appears to be an older woman.

   And then we catch up with Carol, Tyreese, Lizzie, Mika, and Judith as
   they are taking a break during their trek towards Terminus. Lizzie
   tells Carol how she saved Tyreese ºs life back at the prison during the
   Governor ºs attack. She shot people who were trying to kill him, she
   tells Carol. Later, Carol shares her concerns about the girls with
   Tyreese: Lizzie isn ºt afraid to kill people, but she doesn ºt seem to
   grasp exactly what walkers are, how dangerous they are. Mika, on the
   other hand, understands walkers have to die, but "she doesn ºt have a
   mean bone in her body," which makes her even more vulnerable.

   The Rat

   Carol and Mika stumble upon a house in the woods, with a huge supply of
   pecans growing nearby and comfy furnishings inside. Lizzie and Mika
   hold Judith and watch the outside while Carol and Tyreese clear the
   house, but a walker stumbles outside and falls over the porch railing.
   Mika shoots several times and nails it, while Lizzie looks on and
   screams... she ºs upset, not because she and the other girls were nearly
   walker chow, but because, once again, her fellow humans have
   misunderstood the walkers and killed another one of them. To calm her,
   Mika tells Lizzie to look at the flowers in the yard and count.

   Tyreese (Chad Coleman) in The Walking Dead Season 4 episode, The Grove.

   "I Know What I Have to Do Now"

   Back at their new home, Carol puts a teapot on the stove, and as she
   looks out the kitchen window, she sees Lizzie running around in the
   yard, being chased by an older person. Or what used to be a person, and
   is now a walker. Lizzie is playing tag with a walker. Carol runs
   outside and stabs the walker in the head, which Freaks. Lizzie. Out.

   She begins screaming at Carol, telling her she killed the walker, that
   the walker was her friend. "What if I killed you? What if I killed you?
   " Lizzie screams. "It ºs the same thing! You killed her! She didn ºt want
   to hurt anyone! She was my friend!" And sadly, it ºs clear that she
   really believes that. Lizzie doesn ºt see the walkers as less human than
   everyone else.

   Rosita:  ºShe ºs Feisty º

   Later, Lizzie sneaks off back to the railroad tracks, where earlier she
   witnessed a walker fall and get trapped in the ground. She feeds him a
   mouse, and promises to bring more. Though this isn ºt what Oprah means
   by having an "a-ha moment," this definitely qualifies as a big a-ha
   moment ‚Äî Lizzie was the source of walker rat snacks at the prison.

   When more walkers, some badly burned, come out of the woods and chase
   Lizzie and Mika back to the house, Carol and Tyreese hear the girls º
   screams and come running. Everyone, including Lizzie, shoots at the
   walkers and stops them before they can attack. This leaves Lizzie more
   confused than ever.

   "I had to help stop them," Lizzie says, more to herself than to Carol,
   who ºs sitting with her.

   "Do you understand what they are now?" Carol asks.

   "I know what I have to do now," Lizzie tells her.

   "Look at the Flowers, Lizzie"

   Carol and Tyreese are away from the house, on the hunt for a deer to
   keep their little family fed. They talk about staying at the house for
   a while, postponing the trip to Terminus. Tyreese says he ºs not ready
   to be around other people, to trust other people, and he mentions how
   much he misses Karen.

   As the two walk back to the house, they look up and see Lizzie, holding
   a knife, her hands covered in blood.

   "Don ºt worry, she ºll come back. I didn ºt hurt her brain," she tells
   them calmly, as they look on in horror at Mika ºs lifeless body on the
   ground. Lizzie killed her sister, so Mika would come back and show them
   they ºre wrong about walkers. And she tells them she was about to offer
   up even more "proof," via Judith.

   Carol and Tyreese separate Lizzie from Judith and discuss: Should they
   split up? Should Carol take Lizzie and go? Should Tyreese take Judith
   and go? They try to come up with any other solution, but Carol, the one
   who has made the tough choice before, makes it again. They can ºt allow
   Lizzie to be around other humans. So Carol takes her for a walk, and
   when they stop at a patch of flowers, she tells Lizzie to look at them
   as she takes out her gun and shoots the girl in the back of the head.

   Carol Confesses

   Even after Carol kills Lizzie, or more likely, because she was once
   again in a position where she felt she had to kill someone to protect
   others, she ºs not done. As she and Tyreese sit at a table inside the
   house, the house where, shortly before, they had decided to set up a
   temporary home, she tells him about another murder she committed. It
   wasn ºt Lizzie who killed Karen and David back at the prison, as Tyreese
   had suspected, Carol tells him; it was her.

   And she hands him a gun and tells him he should do what he has to. He ºs
   furious, and wraps his hand around the gun, but after asking if Karen ºs
   death was quick, and being assured she didn ºt suffer, Tyreese tells
   Carol he forgives her. He won ºt forget, but he forgives her, and the
   next morning, they pack up and, with Judith, forge on towards Terminus.

   Zombie Bites:

   * Carol ºs guilt, when she tells Tyreese she should have foreseen what
   happened with Lizzie, is this: She did see it; she just didn ºt realize
   exactly what it would mean. But Lizzie revealed she wasn ºt afraid to
   kill people. It was walkers she sympathized with. Mika, meanwhile, told
   Carol she wasn ºt capable of killing people, even bad people, even in a
   situation of self-defense. Ultimately, that ºs what happened: Lizzie
   killed her sister, thinking she would reanimate and prove walkers are
   misunderstood. And Mika, even when her sister was about to kill her,
   clearly couldn ºt react in her own defense.

   * The giant smoke puff that burned not too far from the house in the
   woods: Did it come from Terminus? Or is there a group of people outside
   of Terminus burning walkers?

   * Did Lizzie ºs mental illness predate the apocalypse? We have an
   explanation for why she fed rats to the walkers; she did not see them
   as the threats they are. But that doesn ºt explain why she mutilated the
   animal in the tomb at the prison, or why she mutilated the bunnies in
   the log in "Inmates." Zombie apocalypse aside, was Lizzie on the path
   to becoming a serial killer even before developing her warped attitudes
   about walkers?

   * As they walked along the railroad tracks, Carol delighted Lizzie and
   Mika with the adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. Sadly, "The
   Grove" evoked memories of "Old Yeller" and "Of Mice and Men" more than
   any Mark Twain tale.

   * Was that a new baby playing Judith? She looked different than the
   Judith we last saw...

   Now share your feelings with the group, "Dead"-heads: Did Carol have to
   kill Lizzie? Could/should she and Tyreese have made additional efforts
   to change Lizzie ºs mind about walkers? And were you surprised Tyreese
   forgave Carol so quickly? Or do you think he really forgave her? Is
   this truly the end of this issue, or will it pop up again between
   Tyreese and Carol? After all, he said he forgave her, but he also said
   he wouldn ºt forget what she did.

   "The Walking Dead" airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.
