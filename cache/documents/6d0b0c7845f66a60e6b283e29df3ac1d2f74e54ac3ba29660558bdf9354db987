   My son was diagnosed with Type I two weeks ago.  He is 19 and very
   athletic.  It was devastating to him, but as we became more educated,
   he began to accept it and I am very proud of how well he is doing.  He
   is a sophomore in college and on a soccer scholarship.  He has played
   soccer since he was three years old.  It is his life and his passion.
   He was so afraid this would prevent him from playing.  After meeting
   with the Endocrinologist, he was relieved to hear that he can play
   soccer, he just has to adjust his insulin, as physical activity will
   make his sugar fall.  She gave him a letter allowing him to return to
   physical activity.  We kept in contact with his coach and the athletic
   director while he was in the hospital and when he was diagnosed.  This
   occurred only one week before the end of his soccer season.  Yesterday,
   his coach met with each player one on one for an end of season
   evaluation.  His coach told him "I would be very disappointed if you
   return to the team next year".  He told him he didn't want him on the
   team and that he would not play him if he returns next year.  He could
   not kick him off of the team and take away his scholarship because he
   has no grounds.    I don't understand how he can do this?  I do not
   think that it is a coincidence that he made this decision two weeks
   after his diagnosis.   My son has made every game except when he was in
   the hospital.  He has made every practice even when he was so sick and
   lost 26 pounds before his diagnosis!  He came in third on the fitness
   test at the beginning of the season.  The only reason the coach will
   give him is that he is basing this on "experience".  He has played
   since he was three. This is his second college season.   He has played
   in National Championships.  He made the Olympic Development Program.
   What can we do?  He is obviously discriminating against him because of
   his diabetes.

   G'day


   I'm really sorry he is meeting the sort of ignorance that he is. Your
   compatriots will be along with information on the options open to him
   under your laws. I thought I may be able to help with some
   encouragement from half a world away.


   He is probably aware of Gary Hall Jr, a type 1 diabetic who excelled in
   swimming. He may not be aware of a type 1 at the top of a tough, hard
   physical contact sport: Rugby League.


   Tell him to google Brett Stewart.


   Begin here:


   IFRAME: [65]http://www.youtube.com/embed/no4rhm8Dto0


   and

   IFRAME: [66]http://www.youtube.com/embed/N1ROmiviI-M


   Brett is usually number 1, sometimes number 7 in the videos.
   Cheers, Alan, Type 2, d&e metformin 2000mg, Australia.

   Thank you for your post.  I plan on fighting this all the way.  The US
    Federal Disability Act was created to prevent situations like this.

   If you haven't done it already, please call the American Diabetes
   Association'c Center for Informationa and Community Support at
   1-800-DIABETES to start the process of contacting an ADA advocate.  You
   can read more about the process at this page:


   [89]How to Get Help


   They work with a four step process to end discrimination: educate,
   negotiate, litigate, and legislate. In addition to helping you evaluate
   your options, the ADA can also help your lawyer by providing the
   information they need to pursue your rights.


   Have you tried moving up the chain of command to an athletic director
   or college administrators who may be more aware of the legal
   implications of what the coach is saying?

   PS


   Your son (or any type 1 athlete at the top level) may find this article
   on Brett Stewarts preparation for a tough match interesting. To put it
   in context, the NRL Grand Final is our equivalent to the Super Bowl.
   This was a description of how he prepared in 2007:[104] I'll have 20
   blood tests: Stewart

   I happen to be a big hockey fan (tonight my Boston Bruins spanked the
   Toronto Maple Leafs 7-0 in Toronto, so it's a wonderful night...) and I
   can tell you that there are plenty of hockey players that are
   diabetics. As a matter of fact my beloved Boston Bruins drafted, with
   the 32nd overall pick of the 2010 draft, a really good young man named
   Jared Knight who happens to be a type 1 diabetic. He's 19 years old,
   like your son.

   Finally, Jared Knight this year (which most likely will be his last in
   junior hockey before joining the pros) has a new room mate (players are
   always put two together when they travel), a rookie called Max Domi.
   This kid is the son of a former NHL tough guy named Tie Domi. Well, Max
   Domi is 16 and is a type 1 diabetic too and he's considered one of the
   best junior player of his year (1995).

   Your son's coach ought to be ashamed of himself and also...he shouldn't
   be a coach of anything.


   PS: if you simply google it, you will find TONS of diabetic athletes
   that had great careers in all sort of sports.

   I would second Molly's recommendation to contact the ADA to see what
   steps can be taken.


   While that is going on, your son should maintain his condition, and his
   grades, so that there can be no other excuse to keep him off the team
   next spring ( or whenever they re-convene).


   He also has the winter to learn all about diabetes. Beyond the usual
   stuff, a a great book for him to read is called [128]The Diabetic
   Athlete's Handblook, by Sheri Colberg. That link will take you or him
   to the Amazon page for the book, where you can read sample pages and
   glowing reviews, and/or oder it new or used.

   page if you want to know more ...

   Just to reiterate what others are saying (and what I said to you in my
   private messge this morning, gonzaldk), please contact us about this.


   While I cannot make any guarantees, it certainly looks like there could
   be legal case for you and your son. We're very sorry this situation has
   come up!


   Please email or PM me at your earliest convenience, and I'll do my best
   to put you in touch with our advocacy department.


   Cheers,
