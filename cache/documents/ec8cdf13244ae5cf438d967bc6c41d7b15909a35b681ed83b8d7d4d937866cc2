Windows 10 Undoes the Disaster of Windows 8 (Mostly)

   Today, Microsoft took the wraps off the next version of Windows. You‚Äôll
   be able to install a free, unfinished [72]‚Äútechnical preview‚Äù version
   this week, or get it in final form sometime next year. It‚Äôs called
   Windows 10.

   (Why is it Windows 10? What happened to 9? Making sense of the Windows
   naming sequence is like solving one of those Mensa ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the
   pattern?‚Äù puzzles. So far, we have this: Windows 1, 2, 3, 95, 98, 2000,
   ME, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10. OK, whatever.)

   Windows 8, as the world now knows, was a superimposed mishmash of two
   operating systems. There was the touchscreen-friendly TileWorld
   interface, as I called it. (Microsoft, at various times, called it
   Modern or Metro; it has officially retired both of those terms and
   replaced them with nothing.)

   And, underneath, there was the regular desktop:

   Windows 10 Undoes the Disaster of Windows 8 (Mostly)

   They are quite separate, these two environments. Each has its own Help
   system, its own Web browser, its own email program, its own control
   panel, its own conventions and gestures. Worse, each runs its own kind
   of programs. Regular Windows programs open at the desktop, as always ‚Äî
   but TileWorld apps open in TileWorld, with no menus overlapping
   windows. Like iPad apps.

   Microsoft believed at the time (2012) that the world was going
   touchscreen crazy. That, sooner or later, every PC would have a
   touchscreen.

   Betting on both
   It bet wrong. Most computers still don‚Äôt have touchscreens. Windows 8
   was a massive flop with critics. ‚ÄúWindows 8 is a failure ‚Äî an awkward
   mishmash that pulls the user in two directions at once,‚Äù wrote
   [73]Woody Leonhard in InfoWorld. ‚ÄúA horribly awkward mashup of two
   fundamentally incompatible approaches that worked poorly on both PCs
   and tablets,‚Äù wrote [74]Galen Gruman.

   Windows 8 was a massive flop with consumers, too. Today, 51 percent of
   desktop PCs still run Windows 7; only 13 percent have ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to
   Windows 8 or 8.1, according to Net Applications.

   And at the Windows 10 announcement, you would not have believed the
   words coming out of Microsoft‚Äôs mouth.

   ‚ÄúIn Windows 8, when users launched a Modern [TileWorld] app, it sort of
   had a different environment,‚Äù OS Group VP Joe Belfiore said in his
   demo. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want that duality.‚Äù

   Now, when I wrote exactly that in The New York Times, Microsoft PR
   descended on me like the beasts of hell.

   The answer has always been screamingly obvious: Split up the two halves
   of Windows 8. Or, as a wise man once wrote, ‚ÄúPut TileWorld and its
   universe of new touchscreen apps on tablets. Put Windows 8 on
   mouse-and-keyboard PCs.‚Äù (OK, [75]it was me.)

   Anyway, here‚Äôs the big news: In Windows 10, Microsoft has done just
   that.

   Mouse-and-keyboard mode
   If you use Windows 10 with a mouse and keyboard, the Start menu is
   back. Not just the Start button, not just the secret Windows key+X
   utility menu of Windows 8.1 ‚Äî the real Start menu.

   And TileWorld is gone. No more screen of big flat tiles taking over
   your monitor.

   Tiles aren‚Äôt gone completely; they still pop out of the regular Start
   menu, a little weirdly.

   Windows 10 Start menu

   And what about all those TileWorld apps that could run only in
   TileWorld? Since TileWorld is gone, these apps now open up on the
   desktop, in regular windows with regular title bars and window
   controls. You can still see your desktop, and you can see TileWorld
   apps and regular Windows programs side by side.

   Music app in Windows 10

   Tablet mode
   If you don‚Äôt have a mouse and keyboard, then you still get TileWorld ‚Äî
   a Start screen and apps that fill the full screen. In fact, Microsoft
   demonstrated how, if you‚Äôre using a Microsoft Surface with the keyboard
   attached, you get the Start menu and desktop ‚Äî but if you detach the
   keyboard, Windows automatically offers to switch into TileWorld mode,
   hiding the Start menu and making your apps full screen.

   Good!

   New features
   There are also some useful new features (new to Windows, anyway).
   Search results now include listings from the Web as well as from your
   computer. There‚Äôs a new ‚Äútask view,‚Äù modeled on Mac OS X‚Äôs Mission
   Control, which shows you miniatures of all open windows when you click
   a button on the taskbar.

   Windows 10 task view

   And you‚Äôll be able to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù windows together so they all occupy part
   of your screen.

   Tiled windows in Windows 10

   What about Windows Phone? It will resemble Windows 10, although it
   won‚Äôt have the desktop view. Microsoft says that laptops, tablets, and
   phones will all get their apps from a single, unified app store. (It‚Äôs
   not clear if that means the same apps run on all those platforms; I‚Äôd
   guess not.)

   Windows 10 looks as though it will be far more usable and less
   confusing than Windows 8 and 8.1. It‚Äôs too bad the whole tile design is
   still mixed in there for desktop PCs, but at this point I guess it‚Äôs
   too late for Microsoft to abandon the whole misbegotten tile thing
   altogether.

   But at least mouse-and-keyboard folks won‚Äôt sacrifice productivity in
   the name of the touchscreen revolution that never came, and tablet fans
   won‚Äôt have to work (much) with tiny window controls.

   Let us welcome the saner heads that have finally prevailed in Redmond.
