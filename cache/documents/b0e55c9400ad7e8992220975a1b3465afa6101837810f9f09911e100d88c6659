   Best Answer:  simple...
   the higher the number of calories from fat.. the more the fat.
   IE: calories from a 100 calorie item.. is say... 30.. then it's less
   fat and better... overall...
   say again.. the item of 100 calories.. and the calories from fat are
   100..then it's real bad... very high fat content... you'll have higher
   cholesterol and triglycerides...
   higher numbers are bad...
   stay away from that junk.. most of it's packaged garbage.... :D

       Calories From Fat is exactly just that..... It is the amount of
       calories in the item that can be contributed to the fat amount.
       For example:
       If something has 100 calories per serving with 50 calories from
       fat, that means that 50 out of 100 calories in the item are from
       the fat.
       Another words, 1/2 of the calories are "fat calories".
       Hope this helps!

       I think KMS answered this question great but I wanted to "piggy
       back" on that answer and add that you want your diet to include no
       more than 30% of the total calories from fat. So, for a healthy
       diet, choose foods that have no more than 30% of "calories from
       fat".

       Calories from fat refers to the percentage of fat in the product in
       relation to the total number of calories it contains. Protein, fat,
       and carbohydrates can all be in foods in varying amounts. All have
       a certain number of calories per gram.
       protein - 4 cals/gram
       carbs - 4 cals/gram
       fat - 9 cals/gram
       Obviously fat adds a lot more calories to foods than protein or
       carbs do. Almost twice as much. Say a product has 100 calories and
       6 grams of fat. You multiply the 6 x 9 which equals 54. You take
       that and divide it by 100 which equals .54 so that food is 54% fat.
       That's really high in fat so you would probably want to stay away
       from that food.
       That's the basic theory behind "calories from fat" on labels.

       Finding the best food is vital to your pet's health and longevity.
       But deciphering pet food, labels can be confusing. You should be
       able to understand pet food labels and be able to compare pet
       products with confidence if you follow the right instructions, as
       pet food has to be just right for your type of pet
