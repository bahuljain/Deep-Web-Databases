A 17-Year-Old Forced to Get Chemo Takes Her State to Court

   UPDATE (April 28, 2015): After her [98]request to refuse chemotherapy
   was denied in January, Cassandra was [99]released from the hospital
   yesterday, the Associated Press reports. Doctors say her Hodgkin’s
   lymphoma is in remission; she received 6 rounds of chemotherapy that
   will give her an 85% chance of survival.

   Tomorrow the Connecticut Supreme Court will hear the case of a
   17-year-old girl currently being held in a hospital and receiving
   chemotherapy against her will. The plaintiff, referred to in court
   papers as Cassandra, is asking for the chance to be [100]considered
   mature enough to refuse lifesaving treatment, the Associated Press
   reports.

   Cassandra was diagnosed with [101]Hodgkin’s lymphoma in September and
   doctors told her that her chances of survival with chemotherapy were 80
   to 85%. Without the treatment, she would likely die within two years.

   But the teen decided against chemotherapy, and her mother, who is her
   sole guardian, supported her decision. Before they could seek a second
   opinion, Cassandra’s mother told the Hartford Courant, a doctor at
   Connecticut Children’s Medical Center [102]reported them to the state
   Department of Children and Families (DCF) as a possible case of
   parental medical neglect.

   Court documents state that Cassandra’s medical team became concerned
   when her mother repeatedly did not bring her in for appointments and
   criticized their diagnoses and methods of care.

   The state intervened, and ordered that Cassandra follow her doctors’
   orders. After just two sessions of chemotherapy, however, Cassandra
   [103]ran away from home. When she returned, she was removed from her
   mother’s care and placed in state custody, and has been forced to
   undergo treatment from a guarded hospital room.

   DCF has since [104]issued a statement saying that, “[e]ven if the
   decision might result in criticism; we have an obligation to protect
   the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts
   that action is required.”

   RELATED: [105]6 Medical Breakthroughs That Matter

   Attorneys representing Cassandra and her mother are asking the
   Connecticut Supreme Court to adopt a “mature minor” doctrine, which
   would allow the state to decide on a case-by-case basis whether people
   under the age of 18 should be allowed to make life-and-death decisions
   about their own bodies.

   “The rights of adults to consent or refuse medical care has been
   considered fundamental in American law pretty much as long as we’ve
   been a nation,” Cassandra’s appellate attorney Joshua Michtom told
   Health. The mature minor doctrine, he says, extends that right to
   teenagers who are found to have the maturity and understanding to
   exercise it.

   Similar laws have been adopted by [106]several states—including
   Illinois, Maine, and Massachusetts—and rejected by one (Texas),
   according to [107]a brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union
   of Connecticut and reported by the AP.

   “Our laws make all kinds of exceptions for people under 18,” Michtom
   says. “They can donate blood, they can get contraception, they can get
   addiction treatment, all without parental consent. They can also be
   tried as adults for certain crimes. Our laws recognize that maturity
   doesn’t happen from one day to the next—it’s a developing faculty, and
   sometimes, 18 actually isn’t the magic number.”

   Cassandra and her attorneys hope the state Supreme Court sends this
   case back to juvenile court for a full hearing on the question of her
   maturity. There, Michtom says, she could present evidence to convince a
   judge that she is able to make this decision for herself.

   Of course, such a decision would have implications beyond just
   Cassandra. “DCF, hospitals, parents, and teenagers would know where
   Connecticut law stands on their ability to consent to or refuse
   treatment,” says Michtom. “Hopefully, that would mean that no teenager
   would ever again be removed from her home and forced to undergo
   treatment in a situation like this.”

   A decision in Cassandra’s favor could also affect teens who refuse
   medical care for other reasons, says Arthur Caplan, PhD, director of
   the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center.

   “There could be 17-year-olds who are anorexic and say they don’t want
   to eat, or who are depressed and say they don’t want help,” he says,
   “and the state may then have to honor those kids, as well.” A court
   would still, however, need to find that these individuals were mentally
   competent.

   Cassandra has not given interviews since being put in state custody,
   and Michtom says most of her contact with the outside world has been
   through her lawyers. Her mother Jackie Fortin has told news outlets
   that their decision is not based on religion, and implied that
   Cassandra [109]sees chemotherapy as toxic—not just for cancer, but for
   the rest of her body, as well. Fortin said in a Hartford Courant video
   that her daughter “may not be [110]able to have children after this
   because it affects everything in your body.”

   Even if her opposition were of a religious nature, says Caplan, the
   state’s decision would have likely been the same. Historically, it is
   illegal for families who don’t believe in medical intervention to
   impose those beliefs onto their children in potentially lifesaving
   situations. (In a 1989 Illinois case, however, the mature minor
   doctrine was used to successfully argue for a 17-year-old Jehovah’s
   Witness who refused blood transfusions.)

   In this case, the court will want to figure out exactly why Cassandra
   is refusing treatment. “That’s the real moral puzzle,” says Caplan.
   “Obviously it’s tough to go through this treatment, but most people
   would say it’s worse to be dead. So they’re going to try learn what
   else might be going on: Is the mother souring the daughter’s opinions?
   Does the daughter have some other agenda? These are the important
   questions, not just how old she is.”

   RELATED: [111]Nearly 75% of Americans Agree With Right-to-Die Movement

   Caplan thinks the court is likely to rule in the state’s favor, since
   chemotherapy is a proven treatment that will almost certainly save
   Cassandra’s life and because she could, one day, look back and be
   grateful. But even if the state does win, curing Cassandra won’t
   necessarily be easy.

   “It’s not easy to give treatment to a 17-year-old who’s physically
   fighting it,” he says. “Getting the court order is helpful, but what
   you really want to do is change the patient’s mind.”

   The state could attempt to do this by having Cassandra meet other young
   people who’ve gone through chemotherapy, or having her meet with a
   social worker or chaplain she can establish trust with, Caplan says.
   “Or they may even try a little negotiation: It wouldn’t be ideal, but
   maybe they agree to treatments every two weeks instead of every week.”

   Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, where Cassandra is being held,
   says it is working closely with DCF, as required by law. “Connecticut
   Children’s is and always will be committed to providing all children
   with the highest quality and most appropriate care possible,” the
   hospital’s Corporate Communications Director Bob Fraleigh wrote in a
   statement obtained by Health.

   Because of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
   guidelines and out of respect for Cassandra and her family, the
   hospital will not comment on specifics of her situation. “Later this
   week, the state Supreme Court will hear arguments concerning this very
   important case,” Fraleigh’s statement adds, “and we look forward to
   their involvement and guidance.”
