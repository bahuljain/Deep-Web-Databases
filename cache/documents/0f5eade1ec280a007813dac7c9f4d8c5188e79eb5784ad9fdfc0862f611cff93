   Why is fat-free milk considered a superfood, when it's simply sugar
   water. I would think that since all the fat is removed along with all
   the nutrients, it would be too high in glucose (sugar) and too low in
   nutrients to be acceptable, much less a superfood. I don't see how
   drinking fat-free vitamin-D fortified milk is any different from taking
   a vitamin-D supplement and drinking a glass of sugar water.


   Vitamin-D is very important, but it's not naturally occuring in milk
   and fat-free milk would keep the body from absorbing it.

   There are approximately the same number of carbs (12g per cup) in fat
   free milk as regular milk.  Only the saturated animal fat is removed
   (which I think is a good thing).  The fat free milk would still have
   the protein and calcium and, as far as I know -- vitamin D.  But we may
   still calcium supplements, because the vitamin D in milk may not be
   enough, unless we drink too much of it.  With diabetes, we have to be
   careful to control the carbs and have the portions that we can handle.
   The amounts that we can handle and work into our meal plans will be
   different for all of us.  Please tell us where you found that nutrients
   are removed from fat free milk, and that fat free milk keeps body from
   absorbing vitamin D.  The label on my skim milk from Krogers says it
   contains these percentages of Recommended Dietary Allowances:  Vit. C:
   4%, Vit. A; 10%, Vit. D: 25%, and Calciuum: 30%.  I would guess that if
   someone has a vitamin D deficiency or needs extra vitamin D for some
   reason, they would need to take extra vit. D supplements.  But I don't
   think this milk is intended to supply everything from A to Z -- but
   rather to be somewhat supplemental.  A well-balanced diet would supply
   other essential nutrients, as well, although milk does have quite a
   bit, which is probably what put it on the superfoods list.

   because the great american med system says FAT is bad  carbs good


   Except that IF you eat NO fat you will DIE..

   you can eat NO carbs and live a fine healthy life.

     I got that from hubby's jug of skim milk, although I do put a little
     of it in my morning coffee.  I was looking at my cartons of
     unsweetened soy milk (4g carbs per cup) and unsweetened Almond Milk
     (2g carbs per cup) last night, and saw that they also have approx.
     the same amount of vitamins in them, in case anyone is interested.
     I love milk, and have always drunk milk, but gradually switched a
     few years ago to soy milk to get fewer carbs, and now am also
     enjoying even fewer carbs with a little almond milk, too.  I only
     use them in my morning cereal, and now cut the carbs in half by
     measuring half cup of any of the above with a half cup of water.
     It's still white like milk and still tastes the same.  I have gotten
     used to it.  Smiley Happy

   I like milk,in my cereal and other types of breakfasts like fruit and
   yogert. I slowly switched from whole milk(4%), to 2%, to 1%, to fat
   free. It is thin but I am used to it now. I have high cholesterol and
   triglycerides, so anything I can do to lower my fat intake is a good
   thing. If one eats a variety of food, you will consume carbs, proteins,
   fats and minerals. If one is careful, one can consume enough of the
   right ones but avoid over doing to wrong ones. But you have to be very
   careful and it is very hard. Exercise I beleive is the great equalizer.
   If one over eats on some carbs, it can be reversed with enough
   exercise. So by drinking fat free milk, I have reduced my fat intake by
   X # of grams of fat. If I am going to eat fat I use olive oil, grape
   seed oil and rice bran oil to get the right type of fats. We can not
   exist with out some fats, carbs, proteins etc.,but it is surprising to
   find out how little of each we really need.

   to me that's going to extremes. But if it works for you and you can
   continue with it great. In my coffee i tried different milk types and
   they all just seem to water down my coffee. i make real strong coffee
   and use sugar free  coffee mate or int'l delight. They have no sugar,
   no carbs only 1 gram of fat, and 15 calories per 1/2oz. Yes I know they
   have lots of artificial stuff in them , but i only use it once per day
   with morning coffee and isn't everything a trade off really. There is
   no perfect system from where I can see. Smiley Surprised

   It is neither a superfood nor particularly good for us. I include whole
   milk and pure cream in my menu in moderation.


   As to "Why is fat-free milk considered a superfood?"; that is part of
   the out-dated but stil dispensed low-fat mantra espoused by the
   ADieteticA which goes right back to Ancel Keyes discredited
   experiments.

   well since I have no insurance and no job and am disabled with diabetic
   nerve pain + a host of other things that are all painful, everthing I
   do has to take cost as the primary. I am able to get only 100 test
   strips/monthe for $15.00, which is a good deal, but if I want more it
   would be $60.00 /100. So testing more than 3 X per day is out of the
   question. The best method and a way to save ones fingers is a glucose
   continuous monitor which I  did a trial on about 5-6 years ago. It is
   semi-permenantly attached with a needle and tube into your stomach fat
   area, and records your BS every 5 minutes. Worked great when doing the
   free trial but the cost was out of site($1200.00). Any way I have
   reduced my A1c from 9.4 to 6.6 in the last 9 months , but taking a lot
   of insulin now to do it. Prior to that was just taking oral meds which
   had mostly stopped working. Still waiting for a cure , when someone
   will figure out how to stimulate those beta cells to reproduce and make
   more and better human go juice( insulin) LOL!
