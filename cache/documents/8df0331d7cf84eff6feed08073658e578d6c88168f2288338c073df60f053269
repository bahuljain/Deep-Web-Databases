   HealthDay Reporter

   TUESDAY, Aug. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) — Needles beat pills for
   treating hot flashes in breast cancer survivors, according to a new
   trial that compared acupuncture, “sham” acupuncture, the medication
   gabapentin and a placebo pill.

   Interestingly, sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness,
   the researchers said.

   Furthermore, the effects of acupuncture were “significant and enduring
   for hot flashes while gabapentin’s effect only happened when a patient
   was taking the medication,” said study first author Dr. Jun Mao, an
   associate professor of family medicine and community health at the
   University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

   The study was published Aug. 24 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

   Mao and his colleagues tested the treatments in 120 women who were
   breast cancer survivors. The women were enduring hot flashes at least
   twice a day.

   Thirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of
   an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham
   acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is
   typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.

   The women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and
   severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of
   their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot
   flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when
   the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.

   Acupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8
   weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and
   then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended,
   acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot
   flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had
   steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took
   gabapentin.

   “The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite
   intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,” Mao said. “The
   magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the
   drug.”

   The results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest
   that “there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,”
   said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service
   at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “There is a
   component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically
   may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking
   the placebo pill.”

   Deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo
   effect is very important in treatment. “In fact, in clinical practice,
   every doctor uses it all of the time,” he said. “The so-called bedside
   manner or communication with patients — all of these enhance the effect
   of the patients feeling they’re getting something.”

   No one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for
   others, said Deng. “It’s like psychotherapy,” he added. “Why does it
   work for some people and not others?” He suggested that differences in
   anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said “there is
   a fertile field for further research.”

   Some patients might wonder if acupuncture that’s helpful for hot
   flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot
   flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot
   flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and
   longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.

   However, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower
   estrogen levels. “Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of
   hormonal repression,” he said. Menopause also is linked to declining
   estrogen levels.

   One big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast
   cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy
   open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some
   women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option
   available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes
   have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.

   But should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot
   flashes?

   “For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of
   possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find
   out what’s most appropriate for them,” Deng said.
