   Locals can come by anytime--although until Labor Day, I will be quite
   busy...
   More on the cruise ships from the original thread will follow--believe
   me that HAS been covered--but here is the next installment...

   My happy New England champion rabbit is heading west against traffic to
   Morris house in CA.
   56 2/7/05   From: mudbox44  To: morris older
   you wanna hear a funny, since i am the office manager guess who gets to
   help them when they cant. hee hee, if they only knew. I fake that part
   really well, learn by doing and acting like you know... only the board
   knows for sure. I now call ya'l the board, my family just shakes their
   heads, when i say i gotta see the board on that decision. Oh i love my
   life. I crack me up!
   57 2/7/05   From: norskabird  To: mudbox44
   Know why I'm up so late posting? 'Cause my DH thinks I'm a little nuts
   to be doing this. He can turn on the computer and maybe get into the
   email if he had to, but that's IT. I kinda get "the look" if I seem to
   be spending too much time here (got dial-up, so it's slow out here in
   the woods...). Actually, I just couldn't get to sleep so decided to see
   if some of my pals were up talking this late. It's nice and quiet at
   11:30 so I can think and plan and just have some fun right here.
   Sandi, you crack me up. You must have a lively office with you in
   charge!!! Keep up the good front...the computers will never know the
   difference...and WE SURE WON'T  TELL! Besides, you're learning all
   kinds of neat "stuff" right here. You're a natural!
   Now, onward ho to the west!

   Hi Lana! Thanks for the reply. I am late getting on board because I
   left work at 4:30pm (central time) and went to Pensacola, Fl. to pick
   my car up. I had to have a new transmission (my 22 yr. old son can take
   credit for that!). I am one dumb cluck when it comes to horses. I LOVE
   to look at them & wish I knew about them. My friend has raised Tenn.
   Walkers for years. Back in his hay day he won the world championship.
   He has tons of ribbons & trophies all over the place. He is too old to
   ride now, but he still has people who train them & show them for him
   and he still wins. He had about 100 at Christmas time. He just sold 18
   and bought another one. He told me he paid "a lot of money" sight
   unseen. It must have been a good line. He once told me he pays about
   $21,000 a month for their upkeep. I've seen him sell them at $40,000 a
   pop & the buyer was thrilled to get it for that price. Yes, he is
   rolling in money , but you'd never know it to see him. He shows them in
   Shelbyville, Tn.
   I joined the local YMCA & hope to start my "trip to Morris" house this
   week. If you have time check out my ticker on the Milage Ticker thread.
   Wish we could come up with a way to show miles, etc. Have a good day
   tomarrow. Just having fun, Birdy

   so, we havent heard from Bob, are you with us to meet at Morris's
   house, we all would like to meet you as well.
   Are you out there Bob?... Bob?
   60 2/11/05   From: morris older  To: mudbox44
   Just curious, is Bob the Forum Moderator?
   Of course you are welcome, Bob, and if the ADA is worried about you
   taking the time off when you should be working on maintaining the
   boards, then you can do so remotely from here. think of all the insight
   you will gain by meeting in person all of the pseudonyms that you must
   deal with on a daily basis!
   We really appreciate the job you do in making this forum available to
   all of us!
   61 2/11/05   From: Bob  To: morris older
   Thanks for the invite Morris (and mudbox). Thanks for your kind words
   about the forum but you guys are the ones who make it all worthwhile!
   You're a long way from Virginia, Morris. It could take me YEARS to get
   there! Guess I better get started.
   62 2/11/05   From: mudbox44  To: Bob
   do ya remember "league of their own", the cigar chomping guy who got it
   all started, that's you Bob, our fearless leader! maybe with out the
   cigar but just as fearless I'm sure! PLAY BALL!!!!
   63 2/12/05   From: Bob  To: mudbox44
   ugh - on the cigars! Wish I was fearless! LOL and you guys lead
   yourselves in this great parade we have going...I just try to keep the
   streets clean!
   64 2/12/05   From: LynnSue  To: All
   It'll take me a while 'cause I'll be coming fromNE Wisconsin. Our
   snow's about gone so should be easy to get walking outside again! Got
   plenty of winter cloths to keep warm and I'll bring along some
   sugar-free hot chocolate to keep the chill off.
   Hmmm, hot chocolate and muffins..sounds yummy to me! I'll have to get
   going right away before the next snowfall comes on Monday...see y'll
   out in Sunny C!
   65 2/12/05   From: morris older  To: LynnSue
     Hi Lynn,
   If you jog just a little, you should be able to catch up with crew from
   Minnesota pushing the red Target shopping carts filled with diet soda!
   66 2/12/05   From: LynnSue  To: norskabird
   Yea, how 'bout that norskabird? Got a red shopping cart I can pick up
   when I get to Minnesota? On our way out to Morris's maybe we can swap
   football stories? I'm assuming you may be a Viking fan....being in NE
   Wisconsin gotta be a Packer Backer and I LOVE my football. Or we can
   chat about any ol' thing for that matter, too. Look for the cheesehead
   coming from the east and you'll see me getting closer!!
   67 2/12/05   From: morris older  To: LynnSue
   Lynn, you better watch out for those Viking horns--I hear they gather
   no Moss, or something like that...
   68 2/12/05   From: mollythed  To: LynnSue
   I was worried that "northeast Wisconsin" sounded a little unnecessarily
   vague but I wasn't sure it would be polite to ask.
   70 2/13/05   From: norskabird  To: LynnSue
   LynneSue! Hey, you got a Packer Backer here! Raised my kids in Eau
   Claire, worked for 6 months in Rhinelander back in '86, and love Brett
   Favre! Got no cheese for my head, no horns either. But I'll be watchin'
   for ya!!! With a red cart, too!
   Hey, Morris - ha ha! You are a wit!

   71 2/13/05   From: ndmmin  To: norskabird
   Hi Norskabird and all;
   I have to admit I am not really a football follower, but my husband
   does follow the Vikes. Can I still come along to Morris' place anyway?
   I just added up my milage tonight and since I started keeping track,
   I've gone a little over 20 miles! I might get there yet! Actually I was
   in the Twin Cities this weekend and spent most of Saturday outdoors at
   Como Park and other places. We even walked around an entire lake!
   (Well, OK, it was a small lake) 3 mile trip we estimated. It felt SOOOO
   good to get outdoors and walk on a 50+ degree February day. Spring will
   get here yet!
   See you all at Morris' place.

   72 2/13/05   From: Bad Golfer  To: morris older
   Hi Morris, I live just south of Seattle, so how far am I from you? I
   put in 4433 strides on the eliptical this morning...it said it was 3.75
   miles. So how long will it take me to get to the party at that rate?
   I'm flying to Vegas next month to go to golf school so I can be good
   golfer instead of bad golfer. Maybe I should start out from there!!!
   And hooray...my a1c was 5.5 yesterday. My husband and the rest of my
   family just don't understand the signifigance of that, but I know
   everyone here will!
   74 2/13/05   From: norskabird  To: ndmmin
   Hi, Nancy. Gotta admit, we do follow the Vikes and would like to see
   them do a lot better than they do. But we're not particularly fans of
   their last 2 coaches, their quarterback or The Moss with The Mouth and
   The Attitude. But that would never stand in the way of your coming
   along! Football is mere child's play compared to what we're all dealing
   with. We need all the help and companionship we can get! I promise not
   to criticize your husband, either. I'm sure that in spite of his
   "weakness," he's a terrific fellow. Smiley Happy
   Which lake did you walk around? I used to live 2 blocks from Lake
   Harriet (2.8 mi. around) and walked it every day. Sure wish I had that
   lake near me now!! When you walk the lakes, you have a whole community
   of folks, and you see many of the same ones each day. After a while,
   you'll get a nod or a smile of recognition as you pass by from some of
   them.
   It's snowing now down there in the Cities, and here, farther north,
   too. Our bare spots from last week's melting are already covered, and
   winter continues apace. I guess tomorrow I'll be walking my 3 miles on
   gravel on snowy gravel. It was cold today, but I made great time. But
   it's already February, so we're more than halfway through. I see the
   green grass on your ticker, and it raises my spirits every time!
   75 2/13/05   From: norskabird  To: Bad Golfer
   Hi, BadGolfer! I had my first trip to the state of Washington in Sept.
   '03 and LOVED it!! Loved Seattle. We sometimes talk about moving out
   there or Oregon, but I think we're pretty well wedded to our families
   here in MN.
   CONGRATULATIONS on your 5.5! We do indeed understand what that means.
   Keep up the good work, however you got there. I see my doctor Tues.
   morning and will learn my latest a1c then. It was 7.1 at diagnosis in
   very early Dec. and 6.3 on Jan. 5th after a month of model eating and
   exercise. My endocrinologist wants it below 6.0, so your number would
   suit me just fine! Are you on any meds or are you managing it with diet
   and exercise? My doc said he'd give me 3 months to prove myself before
   he'd
   consider putting me on meds, so I hope for a good report.
   As for golfing badly...I've tried golf years ago and could never get
   the ball up in the air! It skittered along the ground real well, but I
   had to admit that I'm just not an athlete. I admire anyone who can play
   the game even passably! And yes, you could start from Las Vegas, I'd
   think. That will get you to Morris' before us Minnesotans, but if
   Morris had to wait for us, he'd be waiting too long. Just keep the red
   carpet handy for when we do show up.
   76 2/14/05   From: mollythed  To: Bad Golfer
   Hmmm.... 4433 strides in 3.75 miles = 1182.13 strides per mile on the
   elliptical machine.
   Then 1182.13 strides times 680 miles (Seattle to San Francisco) =
   803,848.4 strides to the Bay.
   A lot less than 1,360,000 steps walking (figuring 2000 steps per mile).
   Let's see.... Northfield, MN to San Francisco is about 1581 miles... If
   I carry my notebook computer in my red shopping cart, I can use it to
   keep track of my miles in an Excell spreadsheet.
   77 2/14/05   From: morris older  To: Bad Golfer
   Hi Bad Golfer,
   congrats on the A1c 5.5, here we all understand how significant that
   is! I was up in Seattle for the second time in my life last year as my
   stepson lives there on an island in the sound--a beautiful , beautiful
   area! And he is bringing the 1.5 year old down next week for a visit,
   forestalling my winter visit to at least spring!
   Unless you can make it all the way from Vegas before your return to
   Seattle, though I think you will have to count from Seattle. But bad
   golf or even good gulf can mean a lot of good walking--if you play
   enough rounds, what is 500 or so miles?
   Anyway my guess is that you won't quite get here before you head back
   home, so at 3.75 miles per day, I calculate you will got the 810 miles
   between here and Seattle in 216 days. Of course YMMV (per day) but if
   that 3.75 is an average, you would get here on September 17, my
   brother's birthday. Maybe we can get him to come down from chico for a
   party and you can join in and then help prep the premises for the
   arrival of the diabetic army headed our way...
   78 2/14/05   From: Vbird  To: mollythed
   Thank you, Molly, for your reply and show me how to do the edit. I
   found out after sending the question and playing around
   with the message board for a while. I learned some thing new from your
   reply too.

   79 2/16/05   From: loweezy  To: All
   Hope a lowly Bears' fan can come to Morris' house, too. I live about 40
   miles west of Chicago but just got back from San Jose. I think it may
   take me a little longer to walk back to California! Think I'll follow
   the railroad tracks.
   80 2/16/05   From: norskabird  To: loweezy
   Hi, Paulette! Oh, you bet you Bears fans can come along! We wouldn't
   let football stand in the way of Morris' diabetic army, no sir!! Just
   bring all that Bears' enthusiasm along for the trip - we're all going
   to have to have lots of energy for the long haul. Just watch for us
   cheeseheads down the road, and you'll know you're on the right track to
   SF!!
   norskabird
   P.S. Congratulations on your great weight loss! You're an inspiration!
   81 2/16/05   From: loweezy  To: norskabird
   Hey Norskabird,
   I wasn't sure after this past season if I could call the Bears a
   football team! I'll sure watch for your cheeseheads!
   Thanks for noticing the ticker. We have about the same amount to go -
   let's do it! By the time we walk into Morris' house we will be svelte!
   82 2/17/05   From: ndmmin  To: norskabird
   Hi Norskabird. I have been so busy this week, haven't hadmuch time to
   read or write. But, I do need to update the ticker, so I'm hoping that
   works on this post. 2 more Lbs gone! I need some new jeans and a swim
   suit for a trip in April, trying to hold off on getting them for a
   while, though. But this weekend, I did try on some suits. Boy was I
   surprised to find that the one that looked the best wasn't the 18W I
   bought last time, but the 12! (I still think it was a BIG 12!). Clothes
   shopping is
   going to be fun again.
   On Sat. we walked around the Como Zoo and then went to Parker's Lake
   Park, in Plymouth, near my daughter's house and hiked  part of the bike
   trail there. Neat trail, on an old trail route, that goes for miles.
   Daughter said a co-worker bikes to work from her apt. in Minneapolis to
   job in Wayzeta. The Mom in me wonders if that is safe, though! I've
   never been to Lake Harriet, and thought about that on Sat. but thought
   it might be busier there. We live just a couple miles from the Hearland
   Bike trail and like to hike and bike that, but it is a long trail, not
   a loop.
   83 2/17/05   From: norskabird  To: ndmmin
   Hi, Nancy! CONGRATULATIONS ON TWO MORE POUNDS GONE!! And a size
   12!!!!!!!!!! eeeyaaaaaaaaaahaaaaa! I can't wait to get there!
   I have tons of clothes in sizes 8, 10 and 12 waiting for me. When I was
   married 13 yrs. ago, I had a beautiful size 12 suit, and I plan to get
   into that some time this fall. I looked really svelte then, so I can
   imagine how great you're looking now -and feeling, too!!! What a great
   reward, eh?
   You'll notice, perhaps, that my wild ticker is gone and a new one in
   its place. I thought I'd try changing tickers when my weight changes.
   The great news today is that - overnight - I dropped 2 lbs. too!!! (I'd
   gained one since I put up the most recent ticker...) It's been SO SLOW
   - no loss last week at all - and I was having to work hard not to get
   too discouraged. I had picked up my exercise in the past few days, so
   evidently I needed to work even harder at that than I thought I was.
   Anyway, I decided on the turtle because it represents the slow pace at
   which things are moving - and the music staff because I've been a
   musician all my life.
   It's only 5 above here this morning, so I stayed in and did 40 minutes
   of aerobics. Hoping that my new Simmons stretch band comes today so
   that I can do that later this afternoon. Walking outside will have to
   wait. I envy you your trails all over the Cities, and one so close. I
   loved those kinds of walks when I lived there.
   Again, congratulations! We'll keep up the good work!
   norskabird
   84 2/17/05   From: mollythed  To: ndmmin

   . I know, for me, the first couple weeks are usually pretty easy, with
   good size drops, so I'm expecting to slow way down in the next couple
   weeks, even though I keep doing the same good things. The hard part is
   sticking with it, even without the encouraging big results, but that's
   the key to really making a change. Otherwise, the same pounds that came
   off easily in the beginning can come back just as easily.
   85 2/17/05   From: morris older  To: ndmmin
   Hi Nancy,
   I am a member of the Rails to Trails Conservancy, and it sounds like
   the trails you mention might be on old rail lines. I have read that
   Minnesota is one of the leaders in converting them to trails. From what
   I have read they are generally pretty safe. We don't have too many of
   those around where I am, but I really do love the concept.
   86 2/17/05   From: ndmmin  To: morris older
   Hi Morris. Yes, I think Minnesota is one of the leaders in biking /
   hiking ( and snowmobile) trails, at least in the midwest.
   The Heartland Trail, near us, links to some others and now if I had
   time ( and energy) I could bike almost to the east coast. I think there
   are a few parts that are not done, though. Eventually, it will link up
   to the west coast as well. Maybe after out trip to your place, we will
   have to walk that entire trail coast to coast. This is a great state to
   bike or hike in, wish I could do more of it.
   Unfortunately, my husband won't bike with me. His urologist told him no
   biking after prostate surgery two years ago. I am trying to get him to
   visit a bike shop, becuase I think I have read that they do make
   specially shaped bike seats for men that are better for them. I'll keep
   trying.
   THe trail I had mentioned earlier in another post was in Minneapolis
   and follows an old train line about 30 miles west. The reason I was
   wondering about safety was that is in actually in the "big city" and
   this country girl has trouble feeling that her daughter is always safe
   there when she's biking, or roller blading by herself!
   Nancy
   87 2/17/05   From: ndmmin  To: mollythed
   Thanks, Molly. I think I have it now. I guess I thought I could just
   change it in the options box, didn't realize I had to go
   back and start over.
   I've been working on the weight since Dec. 8 and had the treadmill
   since the 20th of Dec., I think. I have always been a healthy eater, (
   low fat, low salt, lots of fruit and veggies ) but now I am really
   watching the proportions, too and that plus the exercise sure does make
   a difference. I still am hungry and crave certain things sometimes, but
   it sure will be nice to get some new clothes, in a smaller size. That
   is a great incentive.
   Oh, and I just read that you are a grandma now. How wonderful! I hope
   he lives close enough that you can see him all you want!
   Nancy
   88 2/17/05   From: morris older  To: ndmmin
   HI Nancy,
   I think I have read about the trail your daughter is using and the
   Heartland Trail as well. When trails like that are established, local
   property owners are often resistant because they think it will bring
   criminals into their neighborhood and lower their property values. But
   it has been shown over and over again that those trails, and actually
   trails in general,
   foster community spirit and end up raising property values. The very
   people who packed hearings t oppose their creation sometimes end up
   being their bigger boosters once they have lived with them for a while.
   89 2/17/05   From: Bad Golfer  To: norskabird
   Hi Norskabird, I'm on diet and exercise, no meds. I was diagnosed in
   October and in December my A1C actually had gone up be a point. I
   almost started crying because I had been so good...eating right and
   hitting the gym 5 days a week. So, the doc gave me a little more time
   to get it down. Don't know why it went down. I'm doing all the same
   stuff. Maybe it just took a bit for the lifestyle changes to show up in
   the blood work. How did your test come back on Tuesday?
   90 2/18/05   From: dershchu  To: loweezy
   Hi can I come to Morris"house too . I live in upper New York about 30
   miles from Canada. I love muffins and foot ball. I guess I have to
   start walking more or I could get left behind. We have a lot of snow
   right now can I ski part of the way or may be snow shoe. kimber
   91 2/18/05   From: ndmmin  To: morris older
   Morris: What is this group that you belong to about the trails? I think
   you need to come back here to the midwest and talk to some of these
   people about the benefits of trails. When I used to live in Iowa, it
   was quite a struggle to get the farmers to allow trails on the old rail
   beds, they wanted that land to plow. And even up here in Minn. there
   was an issue last fall with some land on the Paul Bunyan Trail where
   part of the trail was actually closed while the adjoining land owners
   went to court to sue for their land back. I'm not certain but I think
   the trail won that one. In the community I used to live in there was a
   wonderful plan for a trail from town out to a nearby lake which would
   have been the only trail within 25 miles, but again, the farmers and
   hunters won, so no trail. It wasn't even a money issue, since the
   committe had written and recieved grant money to pay for all the work.
   We here a lot around here about how to keep young people in our small
   rural communities, and i really think good recreational opportunities (
   along with good medical care) is one of the most important ways to do
   that.
   Maybe us T2s are just more aware of the benefits of good exercise than
   the anti-trail people! Oops, I think we are off the topic, but it is
   nice to find someone who really realizes the importance of these
   trails.

   Hi Morris,
   New to this board too. Everyone seems so friendly! My school too in NY
   was on strike in '68. What school did you go to?

   Hi Nancy,
   One of the trail groups I belong to is the Rails to Trails Conservancy,
   which is a national association of people supporting the conversion of
   old railroad rights of way to trails. They have recently set a goal
   that "by 2020, 90% of Americans will live within 3 miles of a network
   of public trails created from former trail lines and connecting
   corridors."
   Membership contributes to that effort and carries the great benefit of
   a baurtiful and inspiring quarterly magazine describing such efforts
   around the country, and discussing the issues involved. Check out their
   web site at [59]http://www.railtrails.org They are having a national
   conference in the Twin Cities in July.

   Hi Muz,
   You are new to this board, but clearly you have been reading back a
   ways, because I hadn't posted that tidbit for I think months and only
   once. Anyway I was at Columbia back then, I'm not sure if any other
   schools were on strike in NY that year, although it became more
   widespread the next year--CCNY and NYU among others, just in the city.

   Hey Morris!!
   I "lapped" your house the other day, but didn't smell the muffins
   cooling. The 3-5 mile walks just keep adding up. Managed to get home
   between the rain showers today.
   To everyone EAST of California: dig out those snow shovels ... the
   weather is coming your way.
   96 2/18/05   From: morris older  To: bearbait2
   Bearbait,
   I am saving the muffins for you guys. I can't eat a dozen or 2 dozen by
   myself!! Let me know when you lap by again and I'l lmake some if you
   have a group to share them with!
   97 2/19/05   From: LynnSue  To: mudbox44
   Wow...Packers and Vikings and Bears!! Oh My!! If we could get a
   traveler from Detroit to come with us to Morris's house we could start
   planning the new DFL! Diabetes Footbal League!! Well, to be more
   specific for NE Wisconsin, I live in Green Bay,
   born and raised, except for the 20 years I lived in Florida. Hey, maybe
   the Dolphins would like to come with us! They could swim thru the
   Florida Bay into the Gulf of Mexico and pick up the Mississippi River
   in New Orleans. Then go North as far as St. Louis Missouri and meet us
   there. We could see if there's a new recruit for the DFL St. Louis
   Rams. Then on our way we'd stop in Kansas City in case there's a
   Chief's traveler that would like to come with us. We couldn't leave out
   the Broncos in Denver, tho it would be a bit out of our way. But then
   we could swing up to Seattle and get a Seahawk! Hmmmm,
   California.....Morris, mind if I leave that to you to recruit...and
   Arizona? Well, I guess the Dolphins could check with the Tampa Bay
   Buccaneers and Jacksonville Jaeguars before they start their
   swim...that'll take care of Florida. But we still have some East Coast
   DFL teams and Cleveland. Anyone out there want to want to handle this
   part of the country? Hopefully, that should cover all the teams. We can
   work on our game plans and who will play what positions on the way to
   CA. Morris, I hope you've got enough land for a football field and
   stands...we'll also need parking! This is getting to be quite a
   project! Oh, well, if we all pull together we can do it...you
   know....team spirit!!! Since it's Morris's place he should have the
   honor of the coin toss. Ready to play some football at the site of the
   new DFL's Morris Stadium? See you all there! You know, this is one
   football league I can tell that I'm REALLY gonna like being a part of,
   so COACH....I don't want to be traded!!

   Hi Morris - Yes, I was reading back aways. I was still in High School
   in '68 and our School was closed for a couple of months due to riots
   and all that stuff that happened that year. (went to FK Lane in
   Brooklyn). This is a nice friendly board and I'm learning a lot about
   my condition. Thanks for the response.

   Hey Lana - I live in Buffalo (well actually, I live 20 miles south of
   Buffalo in the Town of Hamburg)!!! I want to meet at Morris's house too
   but have to figure out how far (not very good at doing that so it might
   take me a moment or two)
   100 2/22/05   From: norskabird  To: Bad Golfer
   Hi, Badgolfer! Thanks for asking about my last week's tests. My a1c was
   up from 6.3 to 6.5. After reading the article about a1c testing in the
   latest Diabetes Forecast, I'm not overly concerned about that, since
   the two tests were done in different labs. I just keep plugging along.
   My other readings were very encouraging: total cholesterol down to 195
   for the first time ever (early Dec. it was 326!); LDL down to 107; HDL
   was down to 40 for some reason, from 47; the ratio between the two
   "DL's" was 5, which is max acceptable, but lower than it's been for
   years. So all in all, the report showed marked improvement in most
   areas. I had my Lipitor raised from 20-40 mg in early January, so
   between that and my proper eating and exercise, I guess things are
   working okay. I never cared so much about all those numbers!!

   101 2/22/05   From: 2live4  To: lindameyer
   Hi Linda
   Well I have been to Hamburg (the antique shop in your small quaint
   town). I could cross country ski to you. It would probably be Spring
   then (at the rate I go). Then we can throw on our sneakers and walk
   together. I live south of Rochester in Henrietta. I dont know how far
   it would be either...it is just very far.
   Lana
   102 2/28/05   From: lindameyer  To: All

   Well, I am starting out for Morris' on March 1st at 5:00 a.m. EST. It's
   only 2,587.33 miles from Hamburg, NY to San Diego. Not sure exactly
   where Morris lives, but I will worry about that when I get closer.
   According to the local weather, might have to start out in some snow.
   Lana - how's the snow in Henrietta? Sounds like you might get more than
   us. Or have you started out already??
   Also, based on someone else's calculations - of 2,000 steps per mile, I
   only have to walk 5,175,000 steps; if I do 10,000 steps a day, I will
   end up in San Diego in 517.4 days (that's if I walk 7 days a week). So
   based on those calculations, I will be there on July 31, 2006. See you
   all then!
   103 2/28/05   From: norskabird  To: lindameyer
   Lindameyer - oh, my gosh, I'm exhausted just thinking about it!!! Take
   good shoes, and if you find any kind of a red cart somewhere, pick it
   up and bring it along. Come to think of it, might we give you special
   dispensation to ski for a while? The experts say x-country racing burns
   more calories than any other sport, so why not?!
   Wish some of us were in the Rochester area to send you off with bells
   and whistles. I was born at Strong Memorial but left Rochester when I
   was 6 to head west to Ohio. Had cousins there who we visited yearly,
   and still have a 95-yr-old uncle there, so I have very fond feelings
   about the area. So - go west, young lady, go west, and we'll be there
   ta greet you on July 31, 2006. Boy, this is going to be some long
   party...!!!!!!!!!!! Morris, are you ready?????????
   norskabird
   104 2/28/05   From: morris older  To: norskabird
   I am ready,NOrskabird, but I can save you a few miles, Linda--I am in
   Orinda, about 10 miles East of San Francisco.
   So that may save you a couple of months on your trek cross country!
   105 2/28/05   From: morris older  To: All
   Hi all,
   I was heading up with a group into the horse pasture Saturday as were
   moving to move the herd from one pasture to another--4,142 steps by the
   way, round trip--and as we walked up I cracked up some friends with my
   tale of an army of diabetics, honing their tickers, meeting at various
   rendezvous points, rooting for different football teams, pushing their
   red Target shopping carts full of diet soda (this was before I heard of
   the $400 worth of Tang --see the Vitamins and Diabetics thread for a
   great laugh) across Minnesota, all on their way to my house to eat
   banana muffins and see the horses
   before continuing on to Hawaii.
   Needless to say, there were numerous parts of t his story that my
   friends found quite amusing. As we approached the horses, one of them
   told me to write up the story and send it to that guy with the show on
   Saturday night--she couldn't remember his
   name. On the way back, she remembered that she was talking about
   Garrison Keillor on Prairie Home Companion and pointed out what a
   natural it would be for him, with the Minnesota angle and all.
   And actually I am tempted to do it, but only if you guys like the idea.
   I think this board is a wonderful place, and although I may be just
   egocentric enough to be swayed by the name or content of this thread,
   this diabetic migration is just crazy enough to encompass everything
   that is good about our on-line community here. At the same time,
   however, none of us who have contributed here had any thought of it
   going public, and so I would like to know what others think of this
   idea before I go ahead. If you guys have serious objections, based on
   privacy or anything else, well than I would have to respect that. But I
   think there is an opportunity to use this thread as an example of how
   people can help each other, how the diabetes world is changing, how
   bulletin boards are coming into their own, and all with a great sense
   of joy and humor. In fact here may even be more here than Prairie Home
   Companion can handle!
   Please let me know what you think of this idea before I start thinking
   any further about how to proceed with it.
   106 2/28/05   From: hap_hook  To: morris older
   Hi Morris,
   Been reading through this thread and have enjoyed what I've seen. One
   thing that has become obvious is that there will be a lot of folks
   heading for your place from the east. It might become necessary that
   they stop by my place first (Hayward area) and leave their cars here. I
   can also provide healthful beverages and emergency pit stops as needed!
   To get ready for the hike to Hawaii, we can do a practice trek across
   the Bay.
   "Alright everybody!...Deep breath!...Hold it!...Down to the
   bottom!...Take a step!...Back to the surface!... Deep breath!...Hold
   it!...Down to the bottom!...Take a step!...
   We can use the San Mateo Bridge bases for rest stops!
   John
   107 2/28/05   From: calbeach  To: morris older
   An army of diabetics with their red shopping carts....you gotta love
   it! I have no objection. I once heard a speaker from AA say that
   alcoholism was too serious a disease to take seriously; I think that
   goes for the big D as well. For me, humor is as important as diet and
   exercise when it comes to coping with this illness.
   108 2/28/05   From: calbeach  To: hap_hook
   Somewhere (probably on America's Funniest Home Videos) I saw people
   walking on water on things that sort of looked like little boats
   crossed with snow shoes. So we can still go step by step, although the
   vision of "Alright everybody!...Deep breath!...Hold it!...Down to the
   bottom!...Take a step!...Back to the surface!... Deep breath!...Hold
   it!...Down to the bottom!...Take a step!...andis TOO funny. However, it
   seems to me that if we can make it to Morris', virtual walking on water
   with our shopping carts should be a cinch!
   109 2/28/05   From: Timsma  To: morris older
   Hey Morris ~ I love the idea! Now I'm envisioning all of us 'deep sea
   diving' along the way too! And then with our Target shopping carts on
   water yet! My family thinks I have gone nuts now as I am laughing
   hysterically! Too much of that expired Tang maybe??? I just hope we
   don't get caught shoplifting these red carts!!! We can be quick change
   artists tho and put our own name on them ~ they will never know then!
   You have my permission! ~ Kara
   110 2/28/05   From: hap_hook  To: calbeach
   I figured that I would have to do the step by step method. I get
   seasick as it is and I don't know how I would handle the
   snowshoe/little boats thingies! Maybe I can put waterwings on my
   motorcycle? But then, that would take the exercise away from the
   project! On the other hand, Hawaii is roughly 2510 miles from th S.F.
   Bay area. My fuel tank only holds enough fuel for about 250 miles (I
   haven't noticed any gas stations in the mid-Pacific). I don't think
   that I would like to push the darned thing 2260 miles over rough water!
   Back to your idea! I guess that the virtual trek is the only practical
   route here!
   John
   111 2/28/05   From: Timsma  To: hap_hook
   WOW ~ WHAT A VISION THAT IS!!!!!!!!!
   NOW MY HUSBAND REALLY THINKS I'VE GONE LOONEY! AGAIN I AM LAUGHING

   FUNNY! ~THANKS! ~ KARA
   112 2/28/05   From: hap_hook  To: morris older
   Hi Morris,
   As a newbie to this site, I don't know how much my opinion matters. But
   this is one area where I do not think that there is much in the way
   that going public with the contents of this thread could cause anyone,
   that I have read, any possible harm.
   As a prediabetic living with an insulin dependant diabetic, I have come
   to the realization over the years that diabetes is not something that
   is real important to keep hidden. It isn't like we are raising garter
   snakes in our derby hats! It is a disease that is becoming much more
   common, and treatable. The fact that many of us are able to deal with
   the situations we face and remain positive would be a good boost for
   those just starting to deal with the situation.
   I really wish that my wife could look on her situation as most of the
   posters on this board do! It is a very serious condition that has to be
   rigidly maintained, but at the same time one must remain positive and
   keep a sense of humor going about this. If I had her attitude, I would
   be using at least Glucophage, if not insulin, by now. Instead, I chose
   to take mydfoctor's advice, monitor my blood sugar, watch my diet, and
   exercise. I've lost 48 pounds, reduced my reliance on
   antihypertensives, and eliminated (at least for the time being!) any
   medications for diabetes!
   I am indeed blessed that I have been able to stave the condition off as
   long as I have. There is an extensive history of type 2 diabetes in my
   family history. So far I have gone longer without having to take
   medications for this than any other male in my family. I owe this to
   several people, besides seeing what my wife is going through, that
   encouraged me to take positive steps in taking care of myself at the
   onset of the pre-diabetes. The fact that they were much worse off than
   I was, and were good, fun-loving people had a very major impact on me!
   One of them told me that of all of the major illnesses that one could
   have to contend with, diabetes is one of the best. At least you can
   take positive steps to control the condition! Try doing that with
   something like congestive heart failure or cancer!
   What ever the consensus is with this issue, you have my support. From
   what I have read of your postings, you are a sensible and sensitive
   individual. I am certain that whatever use this thread gets put to, it
   will be done with the proper attitude and taste.
   John
   113 2/28/05   From: mollythed  To: Timsma
   No, we're not going to shoplift the carts. The idea is to get corporate
   sponsorship. I'm sure other states can find their own sponsors too.
   Sort of like auto racing.
   114 2/28/05   From: Timsma  To: mollythed
   OOPS! FORGOT ABOUT THE CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP PART ~ THANKS FOR
   REMINDING ME! I FEEL BETTER NOW. MUST BE THIS DANG
   PERIMENAUPAUSE THING ~ YEP, THAT'S WHAT I'LL BLAME IT ON! ~ KARA

   Hi everyone ! I haven't chimed in since early on in this thread, but I
   have begun my walk. I haven't gone far though, slight setback with
   non-diabetic health issue. Anyway, can I get back in? I have 2525 to
   get there. My shopping cart will be gray , one of the new Wal Mart
   carts as the nearest Target is 100 miles south of me. If I spot one on
   my way I'll see if I they'll let me swap my gray for a pretty red one!

   I love how this thread has taken a life of its own, when i tell people
   and laugh hysterically, they look at me as though i am the weird one,
   duh... your doing what? they must have no sense of adventure. I am
   trying to thinks of something in my area that would be interesting for
   all of you to see, close to the canyonlands and right in the middle of
   the desert, anybody wanna see a cactus?
   118 3/1/05   From: lindameyer  To: All
   Well, I started my journey at 5:20 a.m. (EST). I'm feeling I might be
   able to do more than 10,000 steps a day so might get there before next
   July! Anyway, its a good thing I started out this morning. The temp is
   in the 20's and although we got some snow during the night it isn't a
   hinderance. It actually looks quite beautiful on the pine trees and
   along the dead weeds in the fields. It's times like that when I
   absolutely love where I live and love the winter. Now, I need to hurry
   and get out of here because tomorrow is supposed to be windy with
   blowing snow and windchills of zero and below!
   119 3/1/05   From: calbeach  To: hap_hook
   John, I've been reading your posts elsewhere, as well as this one, and
   have great empathy for your situation. Your wife is very lucky to have
   you in her corner, and eventually she will realize that. Now, you said
   "It isn't like we are raising garter snakes in our derby hats!"
   That's what our army of diabetics has been missing - hats! So, Morris,
   tell your friends we will be recognizable by our derby hats (hopefully
   the Minnesotans can pick some up for everybody at Target).
   120 3/1/05   From: bearbait2  To: lindameyer
   Morris lives east of San Francisco, not San Diego. I'm a bit further
   east of him, so I make a lap around his house
   every week or so.
   121 3/1/05   From: mollythed  To: bearbait2
   So maybe I'll just have to run around in circles too, when I get out to
   the freeway and I'm waiting for the rest of my Minnesota group. Either
   that, or head back into town and go hat shopping. Does it have to be
   derbies? Maybe I could get a good deal on some knit Purple Viking caps
   on winter clearance. I might even find some green Packers hats for
   dissenters like Norskabird who dwell among us.
   122 3/1/05   From: hap_hook  To: calbeach
   Calbeach, thanks for the thoughtful reply! Will continue to work the
   situation!
   In addition to the Derby Hats, could you have the troops from Minnesota
   bring along some lefska and the latest Ole and Lena jokes?

    Hi Morris, Just be sure we all know when to be listening to NPR. I'm
   wondering if maybe he will want to put our story on one of his CD's and
   then Target, naturally, will carry it and create a big ad campaign out
   of it. By the way, does skiing count on our walk? I was skiing for 4
   days last week and put in lots of miles. See you long about August.
   128 3/1/05   From: hap_hook  To: norskabird
   Yah-huh! Got more den I barguned fer vit the Ole and Lena - you betcha!
   Vas serious 'bout the lefsa thou. Can't get it here in Calif. (At least
   I haven't been able to find it. When I want it I have to make it
   myself! If you are ready for this...A Scots-Irish making lefsa! Yes
   Harriet, I do eat lutafisk as well...) If you bring the Viking Caps
   with you, Don't wear them
   around Hegenberger and I880 in Oakland! It could be hazardous to your
   health! (Approximate location of the "Black Hole" of the Raiders fans!
   Dem bullet caps vit da' horns sure makes dem guys crazy! Uf da!)
   It seems that I need to address an misunderstanding on my part. I got
   the impression that Morris lived in San Francisco. I guess that I am
   mistaken. I hear that he lives further east. It now appears that my
   place will be the last pit stop prior to the trek to Hawaii! After my
   place we get to practice by walking across the bay, and then we get to
   the hills on the
   peninsula, and then we get to the Pacific. Make sure that you bring you
   hooded sweatshirts to wear over your Hawaiian Flowerty shirts. The
   Pacific this far north is VERY, VERY COLD! People have been known to
   turn blue in mid summer. Especially after going into the water!

   Alan - Just read the story of Oscar Speck -- very interesting. I'd
   never heard of him. SO, when do you start paddling? At least you are on
   the East coast, tee hee.  Vicki
   Live (to the max), Love (and hopefully be loved), Laugh (at every
   opportunity),
   Eat (healthily), Pray (if it suits you), Love (yourself enough - to put
   your  health first).
   Diagnosed 2001,  I am a work in progress = progressing to not let 'D'
   control me - with the help of my 'D' family here.

   I just added the additional sections of his story. It was an amazing
   trek, in that era or any other.

   Debit, do you know that you live just north of me.  I live in Richmond
   Beach to be exact. I am not a coffee fan of any kind but I will drink
   water or even iced tea on the occasion as long as it is corn and sugar
   free. Speechlady lives further north but she can pick us up on the way.
   We can walk together. All the more fun right?
   Also for those who are new to walking to Morris' house, after we all
   meet at his place we are all going to going  to Hawaii.

   Cool!  Didn't realize how close you are- we should meet up!  Speech
   lady is where?  We should all meet up for a walk - or something-
   training for our walk to Morris's?

   I remember that thread from long ago.  I think I signed up and then the
   thread seemed to have gone away.
   Time to start again.
   However, I have a question.  From my house to San Fran is 2,783 miles
   on I-80 and would take 1 day, 20 hours driving.  However, if I take
   I-70, then I-80 it would be 2784 miles and take 1 day and 21 hours
   driving.  I want to make sure I avoid that mile that takes the extra
   hour.  Walking that mile could take a month!

   I remember walking to Morri's House!
   It has been years since I have been here, the place has changed and
   once again the ole lady is totally lost here so if you find me, direct
   me in the right direction of where ever I should be. Now I gotta figure
   out where I am and how to get there. I can get lost going around the
   block. And when I get bored at work I go exploring on the net (hey work
   is done lol)and usually end up in the land of diabetes sites. go figure
   I am gayle a very young woman of almost 65 years, have had diabetes for
   about 16 years, very compulsive about my health, tho my doctor finds me
   amusing the way I am lol. I am in control and have been for years, well
   then the ole thyroid got jealous of the attention I was given to the
   other two organs so it decided to misbehave and could not just be a
   normal hyperactive,no had to give me Graves disease which at my age is
   not as common, but then I am not the normal person. So anyhoo dove
   right back in and got everything back into control...body acting like a
   bunch of spoiled kids.
   And I could not find a introduce yourself so here I am...but in a
   nutshell - married, still work full time, reside in New Hampshire,
   owned by several furbabies, crochet and gardening for relaxing,  on
   metformin and exercise...and yes I still eat chocolate, and once in a
   while icecream and pizza !
   Now to go figure out where the heck Morris' house is
