   Do you eat well, exercise often, and still feel like you’re not losing
   that stubborn weight? Truth is, eating well and exercising often is a
   very relative and general statement. If we’re honest with ourselves,
   I’m sure we could admit that we’re all capable of trying a little
   harder in both areas.

   Total-body wellness is a lifestyle. Fat loss happens when you ditch the
   scale, find an activity you enjoy, and start to see food as fuel
   instead of something to [99]feed your emotions or occupy your time.

   No matter who you are or what your background is, chances are one of
   these 7 reasons could be why you’re not shedding pounds:

You’re eating wrong foods

   If you’re not losing weight, the first place you should be looking is
   the kitchen. Some people focus all their energy on burning off calories
   that they don’t take the time to consider what they’re putting in as
   fuel. Diet is at least 80% of the battle. While the exact foods you
   should be eating depend heavily on your body type, metabolism, and
   other factors, a good rule of thumb is to stick to all [100]natural,
   whole foods.

   Eat most of your starchy carbohydrates (like potatoes, brown rice,
   grains) on days when you do strength training or more rigorous
   exercise. On your rest days or when you’re doing light cardio, try to
   stick to just protein and veggies and not a lot of those starchy foods.
   Avoid excess bread, sugar, and anything else that’s processed. Look for
   foods that have the fewest ingredients on the label—if you can’t
   pronounce it, it’s probably not something you want to be putting in
   your body.

You’re eating too much

   If you’ve already cleaned up your diet big time and you’re still not
   losing weight, it may be that you’re simply eating too much. In order
   to shed pounds your body needs to run a calorie deficit, meaning you
   need to burn more than you consume. That being said, you shouldn’t have
   to deprive yourself either. Life is about balance. Don’t become
   consumed with counting calories or weighing yourself every day.

   Eat whenever you’re hungry and eat slowly enough so you can stop just
   before you get full. Healthy snacking during the day will keep you from
   [102]overeating during meals. I always carry a few Kind Bars in my bag,
   because they’re a great snack made with whole foods, and have nothing
   artificial. And don’t be afraid to give yourself ‘healthy’ cheats, like
   a few chocolate-covered strawberries or coconut chia seed pudding. The
   moment you start depriving yourself is when you start to feel like
   you’re missing out on something and you want to binge.

   RELATED: [103]10 Mistakes That Make Cravings Worse

You’re doing too much cardio

   Yes, cardio is a necessary part of your workout routine. It keeps your
   heart healthy, boosts your metabolism, and gives you a good sweat (you
   should break one daily). However, only doing cardio—or doing too much
   of it—can actually add to the problem. Longer cardio sessions like
   staying on the elliptical for 90 minutes or going for regular 10-mile
   runs can eat away at your lean muscle mass, which is essential for
   [104]increasing your metabolism to burn more calories.

   It causes the body to become more endurance-focused, storing energy as
   fat to ensure it has plenty of reserve fuel to keep you going for all
   those miles. Not to mention it dramatically increases your appetite,
   making you more susceptible to unnecessary snacking or overeating.

   RELATED: [105]7 Workout Habits You Should Drop Now

You’re not lifting weights

   This one goes hand in hand with #3. I’m not saying you can’t or
   shouldn’t do cardio. If you love to run or bike for reasons other than
   losing weight, then by all means don’t stop. But if your primary goal
   is fat loss, there are other forms of exercise that give a much better
   bang for your buck. The best way to lose weight and [106]build lean
   muscle by doing some form of [107]strength training in addition to your
   cardio. The more muscle tone your body has, the more fat you’ll burn.

   If you’re not ready to give up your cardio routine just yet, try adding
   some [108]interval training by performing short bursts of all-out
   effort mixed into your regular session. These workouts are much more
   effective at promoting hormones that target stubborn fat. Then, start
   adding some resistance training to your routine. [109]Body weight
   exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges are a great place to start
   to help build up to [110]lifting actual weights.

   RELATED: [111]11 Reasons Why You’re Not Losing Belly Fat

You’re not working hard enough

   There’s no exact equation to working out and eating healthy—it’s a
   matter of trial and error, finding out what works specifically for your
   body. And more time spent in the gym doesn’t always equal a more fit
   person. Unless you’re an athlete, body builder, or a
   marathoner-in-training, the average person shouldn’t be working out
   more than an hour a day.

   Your workouts should be intensity-dependent, not time dependent. Keep
   this fact in mind: [112]the harder you work, the shorter your workout
   time may need to be. That’s why it’s so important to maximize your time
   spent in the gym or fitness class so you can achieve that coveted
   ‘afterburn’ effect which keeps your metabolism revved for 24-48 hours
   afterward.

You’re not taking time to recover

   When you do achieve that afterburn and you’re really feeling your
   workout the next day, those are the days to focus on different muscle
   groups. Or, if you prefer to work out your whole body, establish a
   workout routine where you work your entire body one day and then take
   the next day to do light cardio, [114]stretching, or complete rest.

   Recovery and rest are often more important than the workout itself.
   It’s during those periods that your body does most of the actual fat
   burning. So give yourself that time to fully recover so you’re ready to
   work hard the following day. Most importantly, listen to your body.
   Push yourself, but also give it some love, too.

   RELATED: [115]27 Mistakes Healthy People Make

Your body is under too much stress

   Exercise is a stressor on your body. When you have a healthy balance of
   exercise-related stress and recovery time, your body is healthy and can
   lose its excess fat. However, not giving your body enough time to
   recover can also be a negative (see above) as you’ll start to produce
   an excessive amount of cortisol, a stress hormone. Cortisol is both
   normal and important when working out, it’s involved in processes that
   [116]give your muscles the energy needed to get moving.

   However, when your body is exposed to cortisol for longer periods of
   time, it starts to cause negative effects, like [117]stubborn fat in
   areas you don’t want. Exercise isn’t the only stressor that can produce
   excess cortisol. A stressful personal or professional life can also
   make your body produce too much of this hormone. When you stop
   exercising, your body stops producing cortisol; however, it may not be
   quite as easy to turn off the mental stressors going on in your life.
   Make sure you’re keeping your mental and emotional health in check in
   addition to your physical health. You should strive for total-body
   wellness.
