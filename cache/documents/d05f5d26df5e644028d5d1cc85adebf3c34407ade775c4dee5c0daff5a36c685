   Alex Beauchesne
   The program: [94]Weight Watchers Online
   Tester Lyla Naseem Gleason; 45; blogger
   Starting stats 5'2"; 142 lb.
   Pounds lost 7
   Cost Starts at $19 per month; sign-up fee may apply (includes access to
   all online features and mobile apps)
   Her diet history
   "Ten years ago, I lost 10 pounds on Weight Watchers, which I regained
   (and more!) postbaby. I was wary of joining again because I didn't have
   time for the weekly meetings."
   How it works
   It assigns every food a numeric value based on its protein,
   carbohydrate, fat and fiber content. Apps include a food and activity
   tracker, cheat sheets to help decode menus and find diet-friendly
   options, a bar code scanner to use in grocery stores to calculate
   products' point values and a database of more than 4,000 recipes and
   266,000 foods.
   Tech triumphs
   "It's a cinch to keep track of what I eatand not overdo it. Using the
   scanner has saved me from buying overly fattening stuff. The Cheat
   Sheets app has been especially great. On a family road trip, I used it
   to figure out a healthy choice when we stopped at KFCgrilled chicken
   breast and corn!"
   What bytes
   "The scanner didn't always recognize every product I tried. So if I
   wanted to buy a certain kind of yogurt, say, it may not have had all
   the flavors. The same was true for exercise. While it gave activity
   points for basics like running and swimming, sometimes I had to break
   down a workout. For example, I entered my sculpt class as 20 minutes of
   weight lifting and 20 minutes of aerobics."
   Expert weigh-in
   "We find the most success occurs when people use these apps as an
   adjunct to a larger weight-loss program that includes ongoing
   nutritional counseling and support," says Robert Kushner, MD, professor
   of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
   Case in point: In one study, dieters with access to Weight Watchers
   mobile apps, online tools and weekly meetings lost nearly 9 more pounds
   than those who went a DIY route.
