   Best Answer:  none of them have codec's to play .avi files .. your best
   bet is to not rack your brain over why it won't play them .. and just
   DL VLC media player .. so far it's played EVERYTHING i've thrown at it
   .. it is now my main video player over all else
   go to [121]http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-win... .. and download
   it .. you won't be sorry ;]

       the itunes software is usefull and windows media is good and will
       play the avi.
       you sound like you have a old computer so u might want to download
       anti-virus and AVG free they get rid of viruses your computer runs
       faster and even emails cant spam you
       you can defrag or disk clean up(both are installed on your computer
       and make it run 20x faster)
       if none of that works go to settings of the program and make sure
       it supports avi

       Yes your pc WILL play AVI FILES.
       Download the MPlayer
       It will play just about anything that comes it's way!
       Google for it or get it from:
       [126]http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/MP...
       or here
       [127]http://mulder.dummwiedeutsch.de/home/?pa...
       The mulder site is where I got it from but I looked for a better
       site because of the graphics on the mulder site.
