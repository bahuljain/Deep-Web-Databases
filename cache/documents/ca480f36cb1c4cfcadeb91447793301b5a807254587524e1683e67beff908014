PCI or AGP Graphics card and slot?

   I have a custom desktop (it was made by someone I know) and so it is
   not of any specific brand so I cannot ask questions based on
   brand/model etc. Anyway, to the point, I am wanting to upgrade the

   specific brand so I cannot ask questions based on brand/model etc.
   Anyway, to the point, I am wanting to upgrade the graphics card,
   currently it has the ASUS A9250/TD/128 which is a 128mb 64bit graphics
   card. I have done some research, and from what I gathered, AGP cards
   have 1 notch (2 segments of contacts) in the contact prong area,
   whereas PCI (not PCI-E) have 2 notches (3 segments). Now from the
   research I did, my ASUS card is an AGP card, but it has 2 notches...not
   one. I do not want to buy the wrong graphics card, so could you please
   tell me what kind of slot I have and which card to buy (AGP or PCI
   based on the info I gave). Just to let you know, I am not looking to
   upgrade my motherboard just so I can get a better graphics card
   (PCI-E), I only want to upgrade the graphics card. I have looked at
   graphics cards and I found one AGP that would be suitable, but it seems
   PCI cards are harder to find. Anyway, any information would be much
   appreciated.
   Update: thanks for answers, I was wondering more along the lines of is
   my slot AGP or PCI cuz the card that's in it now is AGP, but it looks
   like a PCI with the 2 notches in the contacts.

   Best Answer:  PCI cards are hard to find, because that was what was
   used for graphics before AGP, and AGP is now about 3 years out of date
   in favor of PCI-Express.
   I just did a quick search on Asus's website fo that A9250 model number
   you gave, and it is an AGP 8X, using an ATI Radeon 9250 chip.

       right.
       your agp slot is 4X 8X. meaning you want a card that is capable of
       8X
       the best agp card is the ATI HD 3850. make sure you get the agp
       version as there is a pci-e version as well.
