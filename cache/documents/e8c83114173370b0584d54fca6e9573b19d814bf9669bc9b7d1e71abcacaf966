When a Child With Autism Wanders, It's Crucial to Stay a Step Ahead

   March 23, 2012
     __________________________________________________________________

   [13520038.jpg]
   By Lisa Esposito
   HealthDay Reporter

   FRIDAY, March 23 (HealthDay News) — The Oertel family lives in a
   red-brick, two-story house tucked in a tree-lined, suburban Maryland
   cul-de-sac. There’s no fence, just a small alarm company sign on the
   lawn that gives no clue to the system’s real purpose.

   The array of bolts high on the front door, the upgraded locks on the
   patio and garage doors and the “burglar” alarm are meant less to keep
   out intruders than to prevent 15-year-old Luke Oertel from silently
   leaving.

   Luke has a moderate form of autism, a developmental disorder that
   affects a child’s social interactions, language and behavior. He is
   among those with autism who wander without a typical child’s sense of
   fear or danger.

   In June, Luke outsmarted a system of combination locks and wandered
   five miles away, through the early-morning rush hour, taking a
   pedestrian underpass beneath a heavily traveled road off the Capital
   Beltway.

   Two hours later the police brought him home, still in his green
   pajamas, handcuffed.

   It was “sheer terror,” said Luke’s mother, Gwynne, of the moment when
   she and her husband realized Luke was missing. To protect their
   privacy, the family asked that their real names not be used.

   Last year, “autism wandering” became an official diagnosis in the
   United States with its own medical code. Some of those afflicted enter
   strangers’ houses. Others end up in traffic or on train tracks. Many
   find their way to nearby pools or ponds.

   An aura of constant vigilance exists between Gwynne and Tess Oertel,
   Luke’s older sister. “Are you with him?” Gwynne calls. “Is he up
   there?” When he’s not in the same room, his mother scans doorways and
   listens for a wrong sound. It’s unconscious by now.

   In the kitchen, a heavy, padlocked chain around the refrigerator keeps
   Luke from tearing into the food. The pantry is also secured.

   Today, Luke, a well-built teen with dark red hair and a couple of
   pimples, is wearing a Washington Capitals hockey T-shirt and thick
   brown pants. Hidden beneath his sock is an ankle bracelet. It’s bulky
   in the middle where the battery sits, and it’s water-resistant. He
   can’t get it off, his mother said, and now he’s used to it. There are
   no scissors in the house. The bracelet allows radio tracking of Luke’s
   whereabouts, within a range of one to two miles.

   About one in 110 children is estimated to have an autism disorder. Some
   are hypersensitive to sounds, smells and touch, and an “itchy” shirt or
   a vacuum’s drone can be highly disturbing.

   It is thought children have individual “triggers” that lead them to
   wander — either to get away from something that bothers them or to seek
   out their particular fascination, such as water. As a result, drowning
   and exposure to the elements are top causes of death for those with an
   autism spectrum disorder.

   From the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Dr. Paul Law led a
   study that provided the first national figures on wandering. The
   survey, conducted by the Interactive Autism Network, comprised more
   than 800 parents of children with autism.

   Nearly half of these children between the ages of 4 and 10 had wandered
   at least once. However, because this was a self-selected group of
   parents — not a random sample — the results might not reflect the
   experience of all families.

   Law said that no matter how vigilant a parent is, some children bolt.

   When Samantha Gardner’s 5-year-old son wandered off to a Brighton,
   Mich., ice cream store last summer, she was hyperventilating in the
   recorded 911 call.

   Minutes earlier, a store employee had also called 911, reporting a
   “child that just popped out of nowhere; he seems to be potentially
   autistic and was running into the road.” The staff kept him safe until
   Gardner arrived.

   “With my son, ‘asks permission’ doesn’t exist,” Gardner said. “He
   doesn’t talk. He can’t ask to go to Dairy Queen.”

   When a child wanders, it can take just a few minutes for the worst to
   happen.

   Beth Martin of Lawton, Okla., sometimes used a tether to keep her
   daughter Savannah, who had autism, safe outdoors. But her constant
   vigilance wasn’t enough, and Savannah, 7, drowned in February 2011.

   Savannah had a history of wandering. “I tried hard to do all the
   precautions I could,” her mother said. “I knew she was a child who
   could go. I was trying to stay one step ahead.”

   On that day, in a matter of moments, Savannah had slipped away to a
   nearby pond and although her older brother and a neighbor tried to save
   her, it was too late.

   Months later, Martin recalled that painful time. “My husband was
   deployed and I was uncomfortable with the ponds near our house,” she
   said. “I was looking for a safer place to live.”

   The day before the accident, Martin had the door alarmed because
   Savannah was getting up at night. “But I was comfortable during the day
   that she knew not to cross boundaries. It was simple as that. Kids with
   autism have routines. I was making noodles and she always waited for
   noodles. I went to the bathroom and when I got out, she was gone.”

   Martin said she shared her story to help other parents.

   For the Oertels, a factor in their decision to move to Montgomery
   County, Md., is that it’s part of Project Lifesaver. The program
   provides known wanderers with radio-tracking devices and coordinates
   with local emergency agencies. Officer Laurie Reyes heads the
   Montgomery County program, where officers respond to calls about
   missing children with autism about every other week.

   Police quickly arrived at the Oertels’ home, using police dogs to
   search the house. Gwynne requested a helicopter, which can detect
   signals for three to five miles, but the police said it was too early
   in the search to employ one.

   Luke might not have been saved without the intervention of two Good
   Samaritans.

   A woman in a car spotted Luke on the road in his pajamas, and followed
   him to a hotel parking lot. She enlisted the hotel security director’s
   help, and they trailed Luke to the Metro station, followed him by foot
   onto the platform and blocked him from entering a Washington,
   D.C.-bound train. He recited his phone number for the strangers, and
   they contacted his mom.

   Police still had to get Luke safely into the car. Reyes recounted
   rescue steps: “We’ll have to stop traffic. Mom has to grab his favorite
   food. We tell her, ‘We may have to put him in handcuffs, for his
   safety.’ Mom got it.”

   Oertel said she was “fine” with the handcuffs — although she didn’t
   want to see them applied and asked the officers not to use a Taser on
   her son. By 8 a.m., he was home.

   Despite the blistered feet from his escape, Luke has said he wants to
   do it again.

   Moving onward

   Autism advocacy groups want wandering incidents to trigger Amber
   Alerts, but because that system is meant only for abducted children,
   wanderers don’t qualify. A grassroots movement is afoot to implement
   “Mason Alerts,” named in honor of Mason Allen Medlam, who drowned after
   wandering.

   Luke attends a local high school, where he’s in a six-year program to
   learn functional life skills. He continues to plays hockey on a special
   team.

   “My first concern is his safety, keeping him safe,” Gwynne said.
   “That’s the number one priority. My second is his happiness. So, we’re
   trying to expose him to all different hobbies to see what he likes. If
   you don’t expose him to it, you’ll never know.”
