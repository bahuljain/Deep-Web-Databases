   Best Answer:  see for games you need a graphic card
   for huge ones you need at least ones with 512mb ram
   The Intel GMA4500 is a pretty decent integrated chip (actually part of
   the Northbridge of the GM45 chipset (and some others)) so if you get an
   Intel processor getting something with that chipset would be a good
   idea (it's actually useful for gaming, though not at high settings),
   there's also the GMA4700 which is slightly higher clocked and a bit
   faster in the GM47 chipset but you might have trouble finding it.
   but i think you would need nvidia graphics for gaming better if its a
   desktop you have better go for nvidia with 512mb graphics memory

       Many games do not require extra graphic cards. However there are
       some new website requires graphic cards for example
       "secondlife.com" .
       For vista, you need graphic cards but what you have is seems to be
       sufficient even for games and vista You are aware that now a days
       every couple of years, all accessories and hardware everything
       become out dated as newer versions of all the hardware is made
       available in the market. Also i suggest if you can get updates to
       the driver of this graphic cards you already have, then there
       should be no problem at all as your card will get updated with
       latest updates..

       The video card is the device in a computer that outputs visual
       information to the monitor. Video cards are also called video
       adapters or graphics cards. GPUs get faster and faster with each
       generation. Now they are at the point where they no longer give a
       benefit to certain monitors. Without a graphics card to perform the
       necessary calculations. There is no such thing as a perfect video
       card for all situations, but by ... social media consultant

       PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU WASTE MONEY!!!
       If you are running integrated graphics chances are your computer
       will not allow you to update to a graphic card. To find out go into
       the bios and see if there is an option to disable on board video.
       If not, you own a store bought computer with a name on it like
       dell, hp, compaq, gateway. They don't allow upgrades so they can
       force you back into the market. The thing is if you are running
       integrated you also lack RAM and a power supply strong enough and
       with the proper rails to run a video card capable of running newer
       games. Everyone else here failed to mention that little detail.
       Sorry for the bad news.

       You should really get a better graphics card if you are going to
       perform a lot of gaming in your system.
       Its like tuning up a car or a motorcycle if you want to win a race.
       There are a lot of games now, especially the new ones that require
       considerably powerful graphics card.

       If you are going to game a lot then you need to get away from
       integrated video. Getting a video card gives your video game better
       performance with its own bigger chipsets and integrated video
       memory.
       Especially when you are planning to use Vista as your operating
       system.
       I am waiting for the new Windows 7 this fall! =)

       well if u want to game alot then u absolutely need a good graphics
       card. Unless the only games u want to play r solitare or mine
       sweeper. Vista basically requires double the requirements for games
       compared to xp. So if a game requires 2gb or ram then on vista it
       would require 4gb of ram. If ur looking to play newer types of
       games then i suggest getting an 8800GT or better graphics card.

       you need a better video card than that to do some good gaming, but
       isnt that card commonly found in cheaper notebooks? Or do you just
       have an intel main board with onboard graphics? but deffinately get
       a graphics card, ATI and NVIDIA are your best bets.
