8 Tips for Surviving a Zombie Apocalypse

   October 29, 2014 | By [98]Ellen Seidman

   Surviving a zombie apocalypse isn’t easy, as anyone who watches The
   Walking Dead knows. Personally, I am not convinced my husband would be
   able to endure [99]iPhone 6 withdrawal and he thinks I would wither
   away without my regular [100]sushi fix. We also might lose the will to
   live after hearing the kids repeatedly whine, “I’m bo-oored.”
   [101]Conan O’Brien recently joked that he’d never make it through a
   zombie apocalypse because, he said, “I’d be killed on a sunblock run.”

   Dave and I have discussed the what-if scenarios and have decided that I
   would be the master plotter and he would handle zombie slaying. The
   supermarket closest to us is kind of small, unfortunately, so food runs
   wouldn’t be very fruitful and we’d have to break the tragic news to the
   kids that no, Dave couldn’t bring them back ice cream. But there is an
   excellent local bakery that makes the best [102]scones and I will
   definitely suggest they stock up the next time I stop by. In terms of
   weapons, we have some excellent J.A. Henckels knives we received as a
   wedding present that could come in handy, along with some toys that
   make sounds so annoying they would surely scare off walkers. Come to
   think of it, hurling the wedding china that we never use could also
   prove effective.

   As it turns out, the geniuses over at the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention have put their minds to surviving a zombie
   apocalypse—they’ve created a little-known [103]Zombie Preparedness
   section on the CDC website. Visitors will find helpful tips such as
   “Don’t drink the water!” and a list of emergency items to have at home
   in case of zombie invasion, or any natural disaster:

   Water: 1 gallon per person per day

   Food: Stock up on non-perishable items*

   * This does not mean sushi

   Medications: Prescription and non-prescription

   Tools and supplies: Utility knife, duct tape, battery-powered radio

   Sanitation and hygiene: Household bleach, soap, towels*

   * I’d add hand sanitizer, for anyone concerned about [104]getting a
   cold during the zombie apocalypse

   Clothing and bedding: A change of clothes for each family member*

   * If you have a 10-year-old girl, I recommend packing at least
   200 outfits, including some with glitter

   Important documents: Copies of your driver’s license, passport and
   birth certificate*

   * Note, you won’t need your Starbucks Rewards card

   First aid supplies: Even if a zombie bites you, at least your family
   would have the kit to keep on hand should a tornado or hurricane
   subsequently strike. That said, the weather on The Walking Dead is
   surprisingly decent, though not once has anyone ever talked about the
   weather. Go figure.

   The CDC recently came out with a [105]Zombie Pandemic novella to
   download, for your information and reading pleasure, plus a
   [106]helpful poster to pin up although it must be said that the Walking
   Dead zombies are far better looking (sorry, CDC) and you should hang
   this in your office cubicle at your own risk:

   Zombie_Poster_highres

   The Zombie Preparedness section reassuringly states that if zombies did
   start roaming the streets, the CDC would launch an investigation—as
   they do with any disease outbreak—and send first responders. It is
   unclear what would happen, however, if all CDC employees turned into
   zombies and only one staffer with a drinking problem remained (see:
   Walking Dead Season 1, Episode 5). The site also doesn’t provide
   information on what would happen should a disaster of previously
   unknown epic proportions occur, like the breakup of Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

   Still, it is reassuring to know that the CDC is there for us. If
   they could just figure out a way to cryogenically freeze sushi, and
   make sure there is an ample supply of low-sodium soy sauce, I’ll be all
   set.
