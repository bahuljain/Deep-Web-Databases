   Risks, though small, include cognitive problems, kidney failure, and
   death.
   (MIKE KEMP/RUBBERBALL/VEER)
   Bypass surgeryusing clean blood vessels from elsewhere in the body to
   create a detour around clogged arteries near the hearthas been hailed
   as "one of the great success stories in medicine."
   In 2005 about 280,000 Americans underwent this procedure to prevent
   [95]heart attacks and relieve [96]symptoms of heart disease. It's
   really the only treatment option for patients with severely clogged
   arteries and people with three or more blockages.
   A safer bypass operation
   Failed bypasses are uncommon, especially in the hands of an experienced
   surgeon. Still, it happens often enough that agencies keep track of
   such setbacks as a way to grade hospitals.
   Some state health agenciesincluding those of California and New
   Yorkissue annual report cards that show which hospitals are performing
   the most bypass surgeries and getting the best results. In 2003
   [97]Consumer Reports compiled a list of links to hospital report cards
   from state agencies and various independent ratings services.

   Volume doesn't necessarily matter
   Don't assume that you're guaranteed good results just because your
   hospital performs lots of operations. A 2004 study found that sheer
   volume doesn't matter much when it comes to bypass surgery. The
   veritable bypass factories might be somewhat safer for patients over
   65, but a big difference has not been shown.
   Risks of bypass surgery
   No matter which hospital you choose, bypass surgery always comes with
   risks. About 2% of patients die in the hospital or within one month of
   the operation. A study in 2001 found that about one in four patients
   developed cognitive problems that remained evident six months after the
   operation. Another recent study found that more than 7% of all bypass
   patients experience acute kidney failure.
   Some patients are especially likely to suffer complications. Patients
   in their 70s and beyond are automatically more vulnerable. The
   operation is also riskier for people who have an additional serious
   illness, such as [102]diabetes, emphysema, or kidney failure.
