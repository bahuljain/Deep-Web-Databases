Team Sports Pep Up Middle-School Kids

   September 28, 2010
     __________________________________________________________________

   HealthDay Reporter

   TUESDAY, Sept. 28 (HealthDay News) — American middle-school students
   who participate in team sports appear to be both physically and
   mentally better off than those who don’t, a new study suggests.

   Researchers say the findings are the first to explore the potential
   health impact that team sports activity might have on pre-high school
   aged children, namely those between the ages of 12 and 14.

   “Other studies have looked at older adolescents and consistently found
   a relationship between engaging in team sports and having a greater
   satisfaction in life and better self-reported health,” noted study
   co-author Keith Zullig, an associate professor of public health in the
   department of community medicine at West Virginia University in
   Morgantown.

   “And here we found that, although we don’t know the exact cause and
   effect, it looks like the same thing is true for middle-school
   students,” Zullig said.

   Zullig and co-author Rebecca J. White of the Philadelphia College of
   Osteopathic Medicine present their observations in the current online
   edition of the journal Applied Research in Quality of Life.

   The study does not explore how participation in individual sports (such
   as gymnastics, tennis or golf) might affect the mental and physical
   health of young teens. Nor does it set out to distinguish between
   various types of team sports (such as basketball versus football) in
   terms of which might confer the greater health benefit.

   But in 2005, the authors conducted a combined general physical activity
   and health perceptions survey of 245 seventh- and eighth-graders
   (primarily white) in two public school districts located in
   southwestern Ohio.

   More than 90 percent of the teens said they were engaged in some form
   of “vigorous physical activity,” while 67 percent said they played team
   sports.

   The students were then asked to describe their current level of
   satisfaction with their life, using categories ranging from “terrible”
   or “mostly dissatisfied” to “mostly satisfied” or “delighted.”

   And finally all students were asked to describe their health, ranging
   from “excellent” to “poor.”

   The research team found that vigorous activity alone offered no
   apparent benefit to the boys in how they rated their personal health or
   life satisfaction. Among girls, those who took part in vigorous
   activity said they were significantly more satisfied with their life,
   but did not feel their health was any better or worse as a result of
   such activity.

   The connection between team sports activity and health was clearer.
   Among boys and girls, those who played on some team said they felt
   healthier and expressed more overall satisfaction with their life.

   And boys who did not play any team sport were found to be five times
   more likely to say their physical health was “fair” or “poor” than
   those who were part of a team. Girls who didn’t participate in team
   sports were 30 times more likely than their team-playing cohorts to
   downgrade their health.

   “But this has to be taken in context,” Zullig cautioned. “We don’t know
   specifically what is going on in sports that accounts for this. We
   think it has something to do with the team dynamic. But there are other
   variables that could play a role throughout. The level of
   competitiveness, for example, meaning if it’s at a higher level or if
   it’s recreation. And the intensity of the coach can also make a
   difference. So this is a pretty small sample, and there’s a lot more
   work to do to look at all these variables.”

   James Roemmich, an associate professor of pediatrics and exercise and
   nutrition science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, said
   the findings appear to “make sense.”

   “The advantage of being on a sports team is that there’s a sense of
   community and a lot of socialization that goes on,” he said. “And I
   think that would or could have a big influence on life satisfaction
   among young kids and people of all ages. You feel that you are part of
   something bigger.”
