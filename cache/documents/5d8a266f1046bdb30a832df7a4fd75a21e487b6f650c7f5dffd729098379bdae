The Puzzling Link Between HIV Diagnoses And Craigslist

   The Puzzling Link Between HIV Diagnoses And Craigslist

   that HIV rates might continue to rise. (Photo: Getty Images)

   [82]A new study has linked a rise in [83]HIV diagnoses with the
   emergence of [84]Craigslist personal ads throughout the US. The
   research, conducted between 1999 and 2008, found that HIV cases rose in
   a city when Craigslist was introduced.

   ‚ÄúOnline platforms offer access to a larger social group than is
   generally available through offline contacts, making the internet an
   emerging venue for seeking casual sex partners. The ease of seeking sex
   partners through classified ad sites may promote risky behaviors that
   increase transmission of STDs,‚Äù study authors Jason Chan and Anindya
   Ghose write.

   The idea behind the HIV study arose when Chan and Ghose were
   researching Craigslist as a means to sell used goods. They noticed a
   large number of ads for one-night-stands, both in major cities ‚Äî not so
   surprising, they thought ‚Äîand smaller cities, where casual hookups
   aren‚Äôt quite as common. Chan and Ghose eventually focused their
   research on 33 states, and found that when Craigslist came to town, HIV
   rates rose.

   "Craigslist‚Äôs entry into a market is related to a 16 percent increase
   in HIV cases," Chan tells Yahoo Health. "This maps out to an average of
   6,200 cases of HIV infection in the US each year, which amounts to $62
   million in annual treatment costs. We further found that the increase
   in HIV trends is linked with the personal ad section, not the escort
   section."

   Now, as casual hookup apps like Grindr and Tinder begin to replace
   online ads, experts worry that HIV rates might continue to rise. ‚ÄúWith
   apps like Tinder and Grindr being used more and more, the likely
   consequence is that we will see a even greater spread of the disease,‚Äù
   Chan tells Yahoo Health. ‚ÄúHowever, this is only a speculation because
   human behavior is dynamic and can be subjected to changes over time.
   With the release of this study result and the increase in awareness
   raised about the risks involved in hooking up online strangers,
   individuals who use these apps might take more precautions or eliminate
   their current risky behaviors.‚Äù
