The Sneaky Health Danger That Almost Cost U.S. Soccer Star Ali Krieger
Her Life

   U.S. Women’s Soccer defenseman Ali Krieger’s body tells many different
   stories. The scar running down her knee weaves the tale of her ACL
   injury just a few months before the 2012 Olympics. The tattoo (one of
   many) [99]on her left forearm, liebe, means “love” in German, and
   represents the years she lived there playing for a now-rival team. But
   she doesn’t have much to show—at least, on the outside—for the
   pulmonary embolism that [100]almost took her life at age 21.

   Krieger, who posed for the upcoming ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue
   2015, explained to the magazine that she “once thought I would never be
   able to [101]kick a ball again.” Two days before the former Penn State
   athlete was set to play in the NCAA tournament, Krieger broke her leg,
   requiring surgery. On a flight before Christmas, a few months later,
   she unknowingly developed blood clots in her leg and lungs.

   “I didn’t know it at the time, but I wasn’t feeling right,” she told
   ESPN The Magazine. “I couldn’t even go to the bathroom without feeling
   out of breath.”

   Luckily, Krieger realized that something was wrong, and headed straight
   for the doctor once she got off the plane. “When I went to the doctor
   they told me it was a good thing I came in, because if I would have
   gone to sleep that night, I probably would [103]never have woken up. I
   was 21 years old and just thinking, ‘This wasn’t even my fault.’ I had
   no idea if I was even going to live through this.”

   Pulmonary embolisms occur when [104]blood clots travel to the lungs,
   typically from the leg if a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) develops.
   They’re often associated with long plane rides, when you’re seated for
   extended stretches of time.

   A [105]pulmonary embolism comes with sudden shortness of breath, chest
   pain, and coughing that produces blood-tinged mucus. In some cases, it
   leads to wheezing, leg swelling, excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat,
   and fainting. If you experience these symptoms, get to a doctor stat,
   as Krieger did.

   Another female sports star, Serena Williams, [107]experienced the same
   scare back in 2011, when she also developed a pulmonary embolism
   following the combination of a sliced tendon in her foot, and a plane
   ride from New York to Los Angeles. Thankfully, Williams and Krieger
   both fully recovered.

   And for Krieger, the health scare helped her appreciate her time on the
   field.

   “You never know when it’s going to be your last time to step onto the
   field,” she told ESPN The Magazine. “[108]Injuries give you
   perspective. They teach you to cherish the moments that I might have
   taken for granted before.”

   It’s safe to say that mental toughness is at least part of what carried
   Krieger and the rest of the U.S. Women’s Team to victory last night
   [109]in their semifinal match against Germany. They are now set to play
   in the final on Sunday.
