   Gotta share my experience at the gym on Tuesday. There's this 50-ish
   man who exercises there, dyed black hair, he struts around like a proud
   rooster. He has legs that look like hams hanging from his body (very
   muscled legs) and he has that "look at me chicks, I'm THE man" look!!!
   Well,,,,short story long, this geezer (who knows how old he really is?)
   was "eyeing" me and watching me on the machines. He struts over and
   asks me how I was doing today. I said well, I'm getting pretty tired, I
   just lifted about 5 tons of weight at this point. He asked me if he
   could show me how to use some equipment. ROFLMAO ! I said well hubby is
   here, he's pretty up to date on the machines. He strutted away like he
   had been wounded. I'm telling you, ya gotta watch out sometimes, this
   geezer tried to pick up his "mother". SAD, but so funny at the same
   time. That was the second time he has approached me and wanted to talk.
   Should I be flattered or tell him to make an appt. with an
   opthalmologist???? Tongue Well that's my laugh for you all tonight!

   RB, I'm very proud of you for going to that pool !!! I too am nearly
   100 lbs over what I'd like to weigh. I still can't get into a swimsuit.
   I just can't do it. We go to the beach usually twice a year and I just
   don't go there with a suit!!! I'll walk the beach in the evening, but
   in longer shorts and 3/4 length sleeves. But you did it, HOORAH for
   you.
   Cougar, I'm not, like I said that poor old geezer was desperate for
   female companionship I think. I wanted to send him to Cindy's mom's
   house and help her with her weed whacker, but not sure she's interested
   either. LOL
   We didn't get to the gym today. My fibro was killing me yesterday
   evening and today; so we went shopping instead. LOL I did a lot of
   walking around, and Rick parks in the south 40 so I can get that
   exercise in. What bothers me is standing still in line to pay. When I
   stop it hurts worse. Picked up some good fish I'd never heard of before
   at Sam's. Swami, I think it was called. Odd name, but they had demos
   and it tastes delicious. Very moist and mild tasting. I know you eat
   lots of fish, have you tried it? If not, look for it.
   Once again, so proud of you for going to the pool and exercising. Keep
   it up. HUGS, Brenda

   LOL about the weed whacker, Brenda! Well, you and your hubby are a
   lovely couple! He's blessed w/ a sweetie!!! Smile

   Brenda, I'm so sorry to hear your fibro is so bad. I can't imagine . .
   . that has to miserable! I hope this fibro flair up gets better soon!

   Brenda, I never heard of Swami! Thanks for the head's up! Smile How did
   you cook it? Yes . . . I will check around and buy some!
   Once again, so proud of you for going to the pool and exercising. Keep
   it up. HUGS, Brenda

   Tai Bo - Billy Blanks - Now I'm impressed! That's a serious work out!

   Today's exercise was two miles walking this evening,and I had to force
   myself to do it.Glad I got up,and did it tho,as I feel energized
   again.I babysat all day guess thats was why,I was so tired feeling.
   Brenda: My mom can run that weed whacker,so don't send the gym dude
   over.LOL! My son showed her how to use it today as he was doing yard
   work for her.
   Great job with the exercise everybody!
   RB: Glad to hear you took the plunge,got the swimsuit on,and got in the
   pool.Yay!!! I hope you find the pool easier on your feet and joints.
   Have a great weekend everyone!

   Cindy, Good job on walking the two miles! Smile Sometimes, the hardest
   thing to do is to get started - especially when we're tired from a long
   day! You did good! Your pancreas thanks you! Tongue
   Hope you're having a great day! Do you live where it's warm and sunny?
   Today it is absolutely delightful in North Texas. . . sunny, 60-70's,
   windy . . . glorious Spring day! BigGrin
   Wishing everyone a great evening!

   Went swimming for 1 hr and 45 minutes today! BigGrin {It's not a
   pattern yet . .. but it's day two of a new start! Smile }
   I showed up at 1300 and hardly anyone was there . . . then . . .
   visualize the Caddy Swim Day in Caddy Shack . . . apparently they have
   birthday swim parties there! There were a ton of people there today!
   LOL I bobbed up and down, dog paddled, back stroked, and just played in
   the water . . . had a lot of fun. (The Lazy River was so packed - I
   thought to myself "this is what spawning salmon must feel like!" LOL .
   . . Of course, we were going with the current, the salmon go against
   it. Wink Anyway - I had fun again today. )
   I'm going to have to buy swim shoes & a hair cover. Getting my roots
   done next Friday. Plus the gunite is a little rough on tender feet . .
   .
   Btw, it's amazing in just these first two days . . . my sugars already
   showing improvement!
   Well, I better scoot. Thanks for everyone's support!
   Now, I want to hear from YOU guys! How is your day going?? BigGrin

   Hi Everyone......It is 81 degrees at my house today so I layed out in
   the sun for awhile with only #15 sunscreen........Yes...I'm living
   dangerously but I want to start wearing shorts and I can't buy everyone
   in our town sunglasses so they won't be blinded by my white
   legs......LOL
   I did some weeding and I rode my stationary bike two times for 15
   minutes each. I also walked up and down my driveway 5 times( that
   equals a mile and a 10th). I hope everyone is getting out there and
   doing something.
   RB....I am so very proud of you.....keep up the good work.
   Cindy......Wanna babysit for me too ???....teeeheee!!! Great job on the
   walking. My hubby wants to start walking and so we may start a morning
   time walk( he works nights)....at least I hope he does....he has been
   doing his weights but needs to step it up a bit.
   See ya.......Big Red..............Peace

   Went swimming for 1 hr and 45 minutes today! BigGrin {It's not a
   pattern yet . .. but it's day two of a new start! Smile }
   I showed up at 1300 and hardly anyone was there . . . then . . .
   visualize the Caddy Swim Day in Caddy Shack . . . apparently they have
   birthday swim parties there! There were a ton of people there today!
   LOL I bobbed up and down, dog paddled, back stroked, and just played in
   the water . . . had a lot of fun. (The Lazy River was so packed - I
   thought to myself "this is what spawning salmon must feel like!" LOL .
   . . Of course, we were going with the current, the salmon go against
   it. Wink Anyway - I had fun again today. )
   I'm going to have to buy swim shoes & a hair cover. Getting my roots
   done next Friday. Plus the gunite is a little rough on tender feet . .
   .
   Btw, it's amazing in just these first two days . . . my sugars already
   showing improvement!
   Well, I better scoot. Thanks for everyone's support!
   Now, I want to hear from YOU guys! How is your day going?? BigGrin

   Hey, RB!!! I am so glad to see you back here and back exercising! Looks
   like you're off to a great start! Always knew you were cool, and now
   you'll be even cooler in the pool! ; )Now, I'm going to have to go back
   and watch Caddy Shackagain! w00t Thanks to you, I received an iPod from
   SantaHubby for Christmas. I have put all my favorite music videos on it
   that rock at my 3.5 mph walking speed, and connected it to the TV. (The
   ones that are a little slower, I use for the elliptical or the bike
   that I have on a trainer.) It's so hard to tear myself away from my
   iPod, I hardly know what's going on in the news world, anymore. LOL
   Well, looking forward to hearing more from you, and from the inspiring
   Julia and Mike, as well. Great job, everybody!
