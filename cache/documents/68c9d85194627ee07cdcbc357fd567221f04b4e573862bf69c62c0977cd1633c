   Best Answer:  The squat is a lower body exercise used in strength
   training. It is also a competitive lift in powerlifting and an
   essential movement in the sport of weightlifting. The exercise's main
   emphasis is on the quadriceps and the glutes, but it also involves the
   hamstrings, the calves, and the lower back. The squat is often called
   "the king of exercises" by those who believe it capable of inducing
   more and faster muscle growth than any other exercise.
   The squat is performed by bending the legs at the knees and hips,
   lowering the torso between the legs, and then reversing direction to
   stand up straight again. The torso remains relatively upright
   throughout the movement. It acts as a supporting structure, unlike its
   role in the deadlift. Proper technique is critical, otherwise very
   serious injuries or gradual injury over a period of time can occur. The
   back must maintain its natural curvature and not "round out" (excessive
   lumbar or thoracic kyphosis), otherwise excess strain can be placed on
   the spine and cause serious injury. Lifting belts can be used to help
   support the lower back.
   So yes, squats are a very useful excercise that can make a skinny guy
   (myself) turn into the hulk with hard work and proper nutrition.

       In fact they can, but only IF you do the proper kind.
       There is a program used by the earlier generations of bodybuilders
       (by earlier I mean pre-steroid era) called "Squats & Milk". Do a
       search for in-depth information on the prorgam, but I'll give you
       the breakdown here.
       You start your workout (after warmup) with 20 deep-breathing
       squats. Your weight for this is your 10 rep max, and you take as
       long as you need to do 20 without putting the bar down. The long
       and the short of the effect of this is it switches the body into
       "grow or die" mode because make no mistake about it - 20rep squats
       are TOUGH. If you can walk okay afterwards, you didn't do them
       properly.
       After your 20reps (only 1 set!!!) you go do some very light
       pullovers (like with 20 lbs) to stretch your ribcage out, and then
       you go through a very simple chest/back workout. Make no mistake
       about this, it may be simple and quick, but it's almost as hard as
       your squats because after your squats you should literally have
       nothing left.
       The milk part: You have to eat a LOT! It's called Squats & Milk
       because the bodybuilders of olde would down a gallon of whole milk
       per day on top of their usual caloric intake.
       That's the basic breakdown of it, but do the research and do not
       just go to the gym and do it based on this answer - I'm not giving
       you the whole thing. =P
       Source(s): I'm on the squats & milk program, have gained a lot of
       lean mass (visibly) in 4 weeks.

       squats work and activate most muscles in your body from your legs
       to you abs to your back. Start with light weight and proper form
       and work your way up. Your legs have 50% of the muscle in your body
       so when you start gaining and building those muscles all the others
       will follow because your metabolism will increase and natural
       growth hormones will be released. Don't waste time with bicep curls
       for now focus on the big muscles like legs and back... squats and
       pull ups!!

       Ugh....how the hell garbage like this keeps getting propagated I'll
       never understand. Somewhere out there must be some total moron who
       makes this stuff up just to see how many people he can trick into
       going along for the ride. "Derrrrr, yea, so I heard that if you do
       2000 squats every day, you'll totally be the next Mr. Olympia.
       Hayuk!" With that said...
       Squats are just one weight training exercise out of many. To get
       "bigger" you will have to hit ALL major muscle groups using a
       balanced weight-training regimen, not just one exercise. Squats are
       primarily for your quads, though they will get other groups in your
       legs too, namely hamstrings and calves. If you're interested in
       bulking up, I'd suggest you start putting together a training
       program with the help of a trainer.
       You will also need to change your diet. Bodybuilders have
       specialized diets that are very high in protein and low in fat, but
       it is not always a very healthy option. I'd look into it or talk to
       a personal trainer, because trying to do it yourself can be
       unhealthy if you don't know what you're doing.
       To summarize, squats are a good leg exercise, but that is it.
       You'll need them, but you'll need a whole lot more before you get
       results. Finally, squats are a great way of hurting yourself if
       you're not careful, so I'd strongly recommend that you don't rush
       into it.
