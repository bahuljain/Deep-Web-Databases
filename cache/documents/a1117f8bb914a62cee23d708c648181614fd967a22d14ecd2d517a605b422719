   announced today they have entered into an exclusive partnership to
   develop a portfolio of state-of-the-art peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   technologies.  This partnership will bring Debiotech's specialized
   expertise to the dialysis industry.
   The new product platform will offer dialysis machines that are
   lightweight and compact, making it more practical to dialyze at home.
   The smaller size of Fresenius Medical Care's new generation of PD
   machines will provide flexibility for dialysis patients when they
   travel, their intuitive design will promote ease of use, and their
   accompanying teaching methods are intended to make it easy for patients
   who are new to PD to use the machines.
   Experts from both companies are working together to plan for multiple
   generations of innovations, offering more patients the option to
   dialyze at home than ever before.
   "This agreement represents an ideal synergy to help patients everywhere
   who suffer from end stage renal disease receive the most appropriate
   treatment at home," said Dr. Frédéric Neftel, President and CEO of
   Debiotech.  "We are very proud to work together with Fresenius Medical
   Care's outstanding teams in order to bring new home peritoneal dialysis
   products to market and offer the hope of improved quality of life for
   many patients around the world."
   "We are dedicated to continuing to produce home dialysis machines that
   are as easy and convenient as possible for our customers to operate,
   because this is what they demand and deserve," said Mark Costanzo,
   President, Fresenius Medical Care Renal Therapies Group. "We expect
   that collaborating with such an exceptional team will provide dialysis
   patients with generations of products that will offer them a new level
   of ease of use and flexibility to help them meet their goal to dialyze
   at home."
   The Fresenius Medical Care and Debiotech partnership is exclusive
   globally, with the exception of Japan.
