   Best Answer:  Yes they can: but till the step of saving a life they can
   not,, ,,,for many reasons;
   1) they can refuse to treat a relative if they fear the interference of
   their emotions in the procedures
   2) They can refuse to treat patients if they do not really know how to
   treat them
   3) They can refuse to treat a patient , if the damage done by the
   treatment is higher than the treatment itself
   4) They can not treat a patient if it is too risky and did not get
   approval from the patient or the patient family.
   5)They can refuse to treat the patient if the treatment itself is a
   crime (like in abortion , where applicable)
   6) They can refuse to treat the patient if the treatment will lead to a
   crime or cheating or against ethics,(like fixing the virginity).. (or
   the treatment by doing another crime,,,like stealing an organ for
   another person to treat the patient)
   7) In cosmetic, they should refuse to treat the patient if what the
   patient wants is not realistic (like liposculpture and a fat person,
   the person should diet first.....as it is not away to lose weight...)
   ---8)I think it is even by law that they can refuse (or should refuse)
   to treat a patient , if the treatment procedures are still in the
   experimental phases (NOT APPROVED YET, ,,,,,unless lots of arrangement
   be done,,,by them, the patient and the medical community
   9) They can refuse to treat the patient if the patient can not afford
   the treatment and is not a threaten situation (lets be logic)
   --edit: They also can refuse to treat the patient if the place of the
   treatment is not occupied with the necessity of the treatment in case
   of an emergency which can happened during the treatment)
   I think there are more cases that they can still refuse to treat the
   patient, as for one answer above me about treating a female by a male
   or vice versa,,,,I should congratulate the answerer for his post, He is
   doing his job well , by irritating people from Islam and I am
   considering converting , ,,,,, good work Adam !!!!!

       I have seen them refuse to treat someone who there is no basis for
       treating; malingerers and fakers (Munchousen's and Munchousen's by
       proxy - I didn't spell that right) or if the person is threatening
       them or the situation is not safe. I will mention the oath because
       it is why we go into the medical profession - first do no harm
       though. I have heard MD's refusing to take a patient based on their
       ability to pay for their services and I feel that this practice is
       wrong. There is also the Good Samaritan Act that protects you if
       you treat to your best ability those in need in an emergency -
       keeps the lawsuits from evolving too. Legally, I guess it would
       depend on the state laws for which the refusal of treatment
       occurred.

       I don't think they should refuse them if they don't have the money
       to pay if it is something that medically needs to be treated right
       away or is life threating. Not cosmetic or something like that. I
       mean if a patient came in and was complaining of paralysis and
       couldn't get up and walk and was young if I were a doctor it would
       concern me as to why a young person suddenly couldn't walk anymore
       and had numbness in his legs and pain but wasn't on drugs. I was
       surely be concerned about what was wrong with this man or woman. I
       was a CNA and I am ver compassionate about people and their medical
       needs and I would be empathic to her or him this is just the way I
       am.

       I think this is a hard question to answer. Morally should doctors
       refuse treatment? No, everyone deserves medical care. However,
       doctors need to live too. If someone doesn't have insurance they
       might have to go to a free clinic and it is understandable that the
       doctors would be worried about payment. As far as murderers and
       such, it is also understandable that a doctor might not want to
       help such a person. But I still think they deserve treatment. It is
       probably best that the doctor not know the situation of a patient.

       I was just told I have hep c (my blood levels are very low for the
       disease and I must have just contracted it a few months ago) by my
       doctor; yet, my doctor lied to me and said my insurance doesn't
       cover my medication. I called my insurance company myself last
       week, and they do cover my treatment. So, I think my doctor is
       unethical and I should be able to sue him because I could pass this
       diease to someone or get really sick if it is not treated soon. The
       doctor I am currently going to will not treat me for some reason.
       Does anyone on here know anything about my type of situation and
       able to maybe help me find out how to go about getting healthy ? I
       just really am so upset and getting angry that I can not get my
       doctor to treat me with a simple medication and he is lieing to me
       saying that my medical insurance doesn't cover it. I just don't
       understand and think it might have something to do with that I have
       medicaid. Is this legal ???

       Anything can happen in Egypt. I've heard stories of many patients
       being refused by doctors in the Egyptian hospitals because the
       patients were too poor to pay for their medical treatment. I do not
       know if the Egyptian law plays any roles here but I highly doubt it
       as it happens all the time and no actions are taken. I know in USA
       you cannot refuse a patient regardless of any circumstances even if
       they are unable to pay u still have to treat them. Hope it was the
       same in Egypt, so many lives would've been saved. Knowing ur a
       doctor, let me ask u, wud u ever refuse a patient if he/she is does
       not have money to pay for medical fees or for any other reason?

       If it is an emergency, doctors must treat the person. Hospitals
       cant turn away cases that show up in their ER and neither can
       doctors. If it is an elective surgery, like some plastic surgeries,
       they have more flexibility. If the person cant pay for a nose job
       or something the doctor doesnt have to do the surgery. Also, if the
       person wants something that isn't in their best interest (Against
       medical advice or standard practise), the doctor can refuse to
       prescribe something or perform a surgery.

       As you said, I won't mention the oath you take as a doctor, which
       means that professional behavior will be set aside. In this case,
       I'd have to say that I could never of course refuse to treat a
       patient under the pretext of financial reasons. However, I honestly
       don't know if I could ever as a doctor bring myself to treat a
       rapist or a pedophile for example. "People" like that disgust me
       beyond belief and my personal view is that they are scum best wiped
       off the face of the earth. Hence, there is no way I am going to
       actually help treat such a filthy pig and save his life. To be
       honest, even if this was not a hypothetical question and if I was a
       doctor in real life, I don't think I could act professionally and
       do it.

       There are times when a Dr. can refuse to treat a patient. That is
       if it is not the doctor`s field of specialization.
       Happy New Year, Hasafer. Hope you are in good health.
