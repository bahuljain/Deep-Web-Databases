   The hospitals that overcharge patients by 1000% The Atlantic Tuesday,
   June 9, 2015

   Try to avoid breaking any limbs in Crestview, Florida. You might wind
   up in North Okaloosa Medical Center, which charges 12.6 times, or 1,260
   percent, more than what it costs the hospital to treat patients.
   North Okaloosa, along with New Jersey’s Carepoint Health-Bayonne
   Hospital, tops the list of the U.S. hospitals with the highest markups
   for their services, according to a new study in Health Affairs. The
   studyfound that, on average, the 50 hospitals with the highest markups
   charged people 10 times more than what it cost them to provide the
   treatments in 2012.
   Where Are the 50 Hospitals With the Highest Markups?
   Health Affairs
   On average, all U.S. hospitals charged patients (or their insurers) 3.4
   times what the federal government thinks these procedures cost. “In
   other words, when the hospital incurs $100 of Medicare-allowable costs,
   the hospital charges $340,” explain the authors, Ge Bai of Washington
   and Lee University and Gerard F. Anderson of the Johns Hopkins
   Bloomberg School of Public Health. The ratio of hospital charges to
   costs has only increased over time: In 1984, it was just 1.35, but by
   2011, it was 3.3.
   In the study, the facilities that marked up their prices the most were
   more likely to be for-profit (as opposed to not-for-profit), urban
   hospitals that are affiliated with a larger health system. Community
   Health Systems operates half of the 50 hospitals with the highest
   markups. The U.S. Justice Department [3]has investigated the Franklin,
   Tennessee-based hospital chain for the way it bills Medicare and
   Medicaid. [4]In February, the company and three New Mexico Hospitals
   agreed to pay $75 million to settle a case in which Community Health
   Systems was accused of making illegal donations to county governments,
   which were then used to obtain matching Medicaid payments.
   Overall, three-quarters of the hospitals on the highest-markup list are
   in the South, and 40 percent of them are in Florida.
   Only Maryland and West Virginia restrict how much hospitals can charge.
   The Affordable Care Act makes not-for-profit hospitals offer discounts
   to uninsured people, but it doesn’t set limitations on bills sent to
   patients treated at out-of-network or for-profit hospitals.
   What Types of Hospitals Have the Highest Markups?
   Health Affairs
   Except for people on Medicaid and Medicare, whom hospitals can only
   charge a government-regulated amount, these high markups negatively
   affect almost everyone. They’re bad for privately insured patients who
   find themselves being treated at out-of-network hospitals. They’re bad
   for the uninsured, since people with no insurance have no one
   negotiating on their behalf with hospitals. And they’re bad for anyone
   who pays insurance premiums, since high hospital prices drive up the
   cost of health insurance.
   “Collectively, this system has the effect of charging the highest
   prices to the most vulnerable patients and those with the least market
   power,” the study authors write. It’s how people end up with
   “exceptionally high medical bills, which often leads to personal
   bankruptcy or the avoidance of needed medical services.”
   The authors say one way to fix this might be to require hospitals to
   post their markups online so patients can price-compare before they go.
   But that wouldn’t work for emergencies, for people who live far from
   all but one hospital, or for the [5]many people for whom hospital
   charging codes are, very understandably, inscrutable.
   Alternatively, legislators could say that hospitals can only charge
   people a certain amount more than what they would charge Medicare,
   which usually negotiates some of the lowest rates. Or, more states
   could do what Maryland, Germany, and Switzerland all do and
   aggressively limit how much all hospitals can charge, period.
   But as the authors note, that last solution would be “subject to
   considerable political challenges,” which is perhaps a polite way of
   saying, “will make the Obamacare battle of 2010 seem like a casual game
   of bridge among friends.”
   In the meantime, that drunken jet-ski trip in Florida this summer might
   be risky for more reasons than one.
