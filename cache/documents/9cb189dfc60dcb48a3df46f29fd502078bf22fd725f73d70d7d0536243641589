       this could be cancer is because I keep my phone in my left pocket,
       and this bump is where the phone is. The phone is an iPhone 6 and
       I'm not sure how much radiation those give off. My father has a
       history of some cysts, so I think it might be that. I have a bump
       that feels very similar in the right lobe of my ear, and that has
       been there for a while.

       So over a month ago I discovered this hard lump on my spine, it
       doesn't move when I touch it but it isn't painful. I found another
       one on my left arm about the same size, hard, doesn't move, but
       isn't painful. Recently I've found another hard lump on the left
       side of my neck, and it's the exact same as the others. I've been
       worrying about these lumps since I found them and have convinced
       myself that I have cancer. I've seen two different doctors about
       these lumps now and they said that they're sure they're just hard
       lipomas and were so sure of this that they didn't do any tests or
       anything. I am struggling to believe what they say because they
       don't have any proof because they did no tests and told me I have
       nothing to worry about. Despite the doctors telling me there's
       nothing to worry about with no solid evidence I just can't stop
       worrying and I've convinced myself that I have cancer because the
       lumps are hard and don't move and I have three of them that have
       suddenly appeared, when I've never had any before. I'm only 18 and
       the doctors also said it would be very unusual for it to be cancer
       at my age but I can't stop worrying. I really need some more
       reassurance or advice, please help me :(

       cancerous or something to worry about. I can't really afford to go
       to the doctor right now but if i could get someones opinion, that'd
       be great haha The lump started on the right side and left side of
       my sternum, it happened because of an extremely ill fitting bra
       that i was too stubborn to change. When i started using more
       comfortable bras, that lump went away. I've noticed since then,
       that the lumps only reappear when I wear a bra with an underwire,
       sleep on my side, or when my breasts are sore(due to that time of
       the month). The lumps are hard and sometimes sore and seem to swell
       only when they are sore but when normal, they do not hurt and
       become small. They are also movable. Could this be a cancerous
       tumor? ;(

       My elderly father slipped and fell on some steps and said he fell
       on his ribs. After a few days you just couldn't take the pain
       anymore plus it was affecting his breathing and eating so he
       decided to go into the doctors. His Doctor told him to lift his
       arms up in the air (which my Father did even though he said it hurt
       like heck) The Doctor told him if he could lift his arms up that
       high that he was confident that he could not have broke any ribs.
       The doctor didn't give him any x-rays at that time and sent him
       home with some pain medication. A week went by and my Father said
       he had gotten worse ....still in major pain, more breathing
       difficulties, lost over 10 lbs and said he was starting to see
       things. My brother took him to the hospital at that time and said
       that the hospital diagnosed him with lung cancer. I seen the
       scan/xrays and there was a huge mass right in the spot where he
       said he fell and his two upper ribs looked out of place to me. The
